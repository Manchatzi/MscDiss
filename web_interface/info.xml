The Conservative diplomat and statesman George Hamilton-Gordon, 4th Earl of Aberdeen, served successively as British Ambassador to Austria (1813-14), Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster (1828), Foreign Secretary (1828-30 and 1841-46), Secretary of State for War and the Colonies (1834-35), and Prime Minister (1852-55). Scott first met him as a guest of Lord Abercorn in 1807, judging him 'a very accomplishd young man who promises to make a figure' (letter to Lady Scott, 30 March 1807). Lord Aberdeen subsequently secured a diplomatic position for Scott's son Charles (1830) and furnished his son Walter with a letter of introduction to the British Ambassador to France. The original portrait by Wivell was painted in the mid-1820s.</description>

		<description>Engraved portrait of the English essayist and poet Joseph Addison (1672-1719). In June 1819, the actor Daniel Terry acquired for Scott a collection of antiquarian material for Abbotsford, including a pair of velvet slippers and a wig-case belonging to the English essayist and poet Joseph Addison. Scott replied: 'If Addison's slippers and wig-box will serve you in your professional dress, pray accept them from me, for my curiosity leads chiefly to articles of armour; and Addison, I know not why, is personally no such favourite of mine as Sir Roger de Coverley should make him' (letter of 15 June 1819). (Sir Roger de Coverley was a caricatural old country gentlemen created by Addison in The Spectator.) Despite his expressed distaste for Addison, Scott frequently quoted his works, particularly the tragedy Cato which he saw performed in Edinburgh in 1812, greatly admiring J. P. Kemble in the title role. The original portrait was painted by Sir Godfrey Kneller (1646-1723) between 1703 and 1712. The engraving was taken from a copy by John Thurston (1744-1822) made ca. 1820.</description>

		<description>Engraved portrait of Sir Walter Scott seated at his desk at 39 North Castle Street, Edinburgh, with his cat Hinse of Hinsefeldt and dog Maida. The original portrait of Sir Walter Scott by John Watson Gordon is a posthumous likeness dating from the 1840s or 1850s. There are numerous inaccuracies and anachronisms. Scott's study at 39 North Castle Street (his Edinburgh home from 1801 to 1826) was lined with bookshelves and featured a portrait of John Graham of Claverhouse where Gordon has placed his own portrait of Scott's mother. The painting now belongs to the Scottish National Portrait Gallery. This engraving by Robert Charles Bell was published as the frontispiece to Portrait of Sir Walter Scott and Five Engravings in Illustration of The Pirate (Edinburgh: [Royal Association for the Promotion of the Fine Arts in Scotland, 1871]).</description>

		<title2>Engraving of a portrait of King George IV after Thomas Phillips</title2>
		<creator>Phillips, Thomas</creator>
		<description>Engraved portrait of George IV, King of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland from 1820 to 1830. George IV, both as Prince Regent and King, bestowed a number of favours upon Sir Walter Scott. In 1813 he offered Scott the post of Poet Laureate (which Scott refused in favour of Robert Southey). In 1815 he twice invited Scott to dine with him and granted him free access to the Regent's Library, where Scott consulted papers on the Jacobite Rebellions of 1715 and 1745-46. In 1818 Scott became the first man to be knighted under George IV and the first ever to be knighted in recognition of literary merit. When the new king commissioned Sir Thomas Lawrence to paint the most distinguished men of the age for the great gallery at Windsor Castle, he desired that Scott be foremost amongst the men of science and letters. For his part, Scott played a leading role in organizing the visit of King George IV to Edinburgh in 1822, the first visit of a Hanoverian monarch to Scotland. The 'Magnum Opus' edition of the Waverley Novels is dedicated to the King. This uncredited print is made from a portrait by Thomas Phillips and closely resembles an engraving by Luigi Schiavonetti in the National Portrait Gallery.</description>

A print derived from Scott's sketch was published in Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border (1802-1804), and the backdrop of Sir Henry Raeburn's 1808 portrait of Scott is also based on it.</description>

		<creator>Unknown</creator>
		<description>Facsimile of the original 1811 plan for the Abbotsford estate, Scottish Borders, with annotations in Scott's own hand. When Scott bought the 110-acre Cartley Hole Farm in 1811 he renamed it Abbotsford. He bought up neighbouring properties until in 1825 the estate had expanded to ten times its original size. By 1821, the residence that he had built between 1812 and 1818 had become too small for the estate and for the constant stream of visitors that he received. A two-storey manor house (portrayed here) was built in its stead. Scott continued to live in Abbotsford following the financial disaster of 1825-26 as the estate had been settled upon his newly married son Walter. Abbotsford proved immensely influential on nineteenth-century building styles, sparking the Victorian revival of Scots-Baronial architecture. The architects were William Atkinson and Edward Blore, with assistance from Scott himself.</description>

		<creator>Brandard, John</creator>
		<description>Front cover of a book of sheet music, depicting John Graham of Claverhouse, Viscount Dundee ('Bonnie Dundee') on horseback saluting a cheering crowd. The campaign against the Covenanters, conducted by Graham of Claverhouse, is the subject of Walter Scott's Old Mortality (1816). In a footnote to the Magnum Opus edition of the novel (1830), Scott writes: 'This remarkable person united the seemingly inconsistent qualities of courage and cruelty, a disinterested and devoted loyalty to his prince, with a disregard of the rights of his fellow-subjects. He was the unscrupulous agent of the Scottish Privy Council in executing the merciless severities of the government in Scotland during the reigns of Charles II. and James II.; but he redeemed his character by the zeal with which he asserted the cause of the latter monarch after the Revolution, the military skill with which he supported it at the battle of Killiecrankie, and by his own death in the arms of victory.' Scott was fascinated by the figure of Claverhouse, whom he believed had been traduced by Presbyterian historians, and displayed a portrait of him in his study at Castle Street, Edinburgh. Claverhouse is also portrayed in 'Wandering Willie's Tale' (1824) and in the song 'Bonnie Dundee' in Scott's play The Doom of Devorgoil (1830).</description>

Scott met the poet and novelist James Hogg while researching material for Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border (1802-03). Scott remained his lifelong friend and patron.

Illustrates the lines: 'Without a moment's hesitation the Frank seated himself in the vacant throne of the Emperor, and extending his half-armed and robust figure on the golden cushions which were destined for Alexius, he indolently began to caress a large wolf-hound.' This engraving was originally made for the Magnum Opus edition of Count Robert of Paris, published by Robert Cadell, Edinburgh, in 1833. The engraver's name is variously spelt 'Greatbatch' or 'Greatbach'. Most reference sources favour the latter spelling.</description>

		<creator>Inglis, Alexander</creator>
		<description>Albumen print depicting the Regalia of Scotland or Scottish crown jewels. Following the Act of Union between England and Scotland in 1707, the ancient Regalia (or 'Honours') of Scotland were deposited in a locked oak chest in the Crown Room of Edinburgh Castle. Over the following decades, their whereabouts was forgotten, and it was rumoured that, counter to the terms of the Union, they had been carried away to England. Prompted by Sir Walter Scott, the Prince Regent set up a commission to search the Crown Room for the Regalia. On 4 February 1818, the Commissioners, including Scott, discovered the chest and found, wrapped in linen, the fourteenth-century Scottish Crown, the Sceptre of James V, and the Sword of State, a gift from Pope Julius II to James V. The Regalia were subsequently placed on permanent display in the Crown Room. Scott described the discovery in his Description of the Regalia of Scotland (1819).</description>

		<description>Miniature wooden-handled brass bedwarmer with a motif of Abbotsford House, Scottish Borders. When Scott bought the 110-acre Cartley Hole Farm in 1811 he renamed it Abbotsford. He bought up neighbouring properties until in 1825 the estate had expanded to ten times its original size. By 1821, the residence that he had built between 1812 and 1818 had become too small for the estate and for the constant stream of visitors that he received. A two-storey manor house (portrayed here) was built in its stead. Scott continued to live in Abbotsford following the financial disaster of 1825-26 as the estate had been settled upon his newly married son Walter. Abbotsford proved immensely influential on nineteenth-century building styles, sparking the Victorian revival of Scots-Baronial architecture. The architects were William Atkinson and Edward Blore, with assistance from Scott himself.</description>

		<description>Portrait of Rebecca, heroine of Sir Walter Scott's novel Ivanhoe. This portrait was engraved by the German-based English artist Albert Henry Payne (presumably from his own design) for a German translation of Ivanhoe. It depicts Rebecca as described in chapter 7 of the novel: 'Her form was exquisitely symmetrical, and was shown to advantage by a sort of Eastern dress, which she wore according to the fashion of the females of her nation. Her turban of yellow silk suited well with the darkness of her complexion. The brilliancy of her eyes, the superb arch of her eyebrows, her well-formed aquiline nose, her teeth as white as pearl, and the profusion of her sable tresses, which, each arranged in its own little spiral of twisted curls, fell down upon as much of a lovely neck and bosom as a simarre of the richest Persian silk, exhibiting flowers in their natural colours embossed upon a purple ground, permitted to be visible--all these constituted a combination of loveliness, which yielded not to the most beautiful of the maidens who surrounded her. It is true, that of the golden and pearl-studded clasps, which closed her vest from the throat to the waist, the three uppermost were left unfastened on account of the heat, which something enlarged the prospect to which we allude. A diamond necklace, with pendants of inestimable value, were by this means also made more conspicuous. The feather of an ostrich, fastened in her turban by an agraffe set with brilliants, was another distinction of the beautiful Jewess, scoffed and sneered at by the proud dames who sat above her, but secretly envied by those who affected to deride them.'</description>

		<creator>Goethe, Johann Wolfgang von</creator>
		<description>Title page of Sir Walter Scott's translation of Goethe's tragedy Goetz of Berlichingen erroneously giving Scott's name as William Scott. Scott began his literary career with a series of translations from contemporary German literature. Of Goethe, the European writer whom Scott most admired, he translated Goetz of Berlichingen (1799), 'The Erl-King' (1799), 'Frederick and Alice' (1800), and 'Lamentation of the Faithful Wife of Asan Aga' (1806). Scott described Goethe as 'a wonderful fellow, the Ariosto at once, and almost the Voltaire of Germany' (Journal, 15 February 1827) and acclaimed him as 'an author born to arouse the slumbering fame of his country' (Introduction to 'Magnum' edition of Anne of Geierstein, 1831). Scott was bitterly disappointed that Goethe's death on 22 March 1832 thwarted a long-cherished plan to visit him at Weimar. Goethe, in his turn, was a great admirer of the Waverley Novels, praising Scott in a letter of 12 January 1827 for his 'wonderful pictures of human life'. Deeply flattered, Scott sent Goethe a copy of his Life of Napoleon Buonaparte and hailed him as 'the father of the German literature' (letter of 9 July 1827).</description>

		<description>Portrays Napoleon Bonaparte in the grounds of the Ch̢teau de Malmaison, the country house bought by his wife Jos̩phine de Beauharnais, which was from 1800 to 1802 seat of the French government. This is the frontispiece to the 1834 edition of Scott's Life of Napoleon Bonaparte, which was first published in nine volumes in 1827. In a letter to Lady Abercorn (April 21, 1824), Scott described Napoleon as 'a strange mingled phantom of grandeur and terror and a little meanness withal as ever bestrode the destinies of the world'. The original portrait by Isabey was considered to be one of the closest likenesses of Napoleon.</description>

		<title2>Steel engraved portrait of Archibald Alison by W. H. Lizars after J. G. Lockhart</title2>
		<creator>Lockhart, John Gibson</creator>
		<description>Vignette engraved portrait of the Scottish philosopher and divine Archibald Alison (1757-1839). Archibald Alison and Sir Walter Scott were fellow members of the Friday Club, a literary club founded in June 1803 which met every Friday evening. Alison, Minister from 1800 of the Episcopalian Chapel in Edinburgh's Cowgate, is best known as the author of Essays on the Nature and Principles of Taste (1790). It has been argued that Alison's extension of Enlightenment theories of association to the realm of aesthetics exerted a profound influence on Scott's depiction of landscape. The artist signature P.M. refers to Peter Morris, the alias adopted by J. G. Lockhart in Peter's Letters to his Kinfolk (1819).</description>

		<description>Engraved portrait of the French philosopher and mathematician Jean Le Rond d'Alembert (1717-1783). Sir Walter Scott quoted d'Alembert in his 'Memoir of Samuel Richardson', originally printed as the preface to the Ballantyne's Novelists' Library edition of Richardson's works (1824) and reprinted in Lives of the Novelists (1825). Scott is critical of the profusion of detail in Richardson's works: 'This process of miniature painting has, however, its bounds; and many readers will be disposed to acquiesce in the remark of D'Alembert,- "La Nature est bonne a imiter, mais non pas jusqu'�� l'ennui" [It is good to imitate Nature but not ad nauseam].' The original portrait by Maurice-Quentin de La Tour was executed in pastel in 1753.</description>

		<title2>Self-portrait of Sir William Allan steel-engraved by W.H. Lizars</title2>
		<creator>Allan, William</creator>
		<description>Engraved self-portrait of the Scottish painter Sir William Allan in Circassian costume. Sir Walter Scott was a friend and patron of Allan and a constant advocate of his work. They first met in 1816, and Scott subsequently invited Allan to Abbotsford in 1818 to help arrange the armoury. When Charles Montagu-Scott, 4th Duke of Buccleuch, asked for a portrait of Scott, he recommended Allan, describing him as a 'man of real genius' who had made 'one or two glorious portraits' (letter of 15 April 1819). The Duke opted for Raeburn, but Allan went on to paint a number of portraits of Scott and of his family, notably one of Scott's son, Walter, in his full Hussar uniform (1821). Besides a number of historical paintings inspired by Scott's works, Allan was responsible for Illustrations of the Novels and Tales of the Author of Waverley (Edinburgh: Archibald Constable, 1820). Allan's friendship with Scott lasted until the writer's dying day when Allan was the only non-family member present at Abbotsford. The original self-portrait of Allan in Circassian costume was painted in 1813. It was engraved by Lizars for J. G. Lockhart's Peters Letters to his Kinsfolk (1819).</description>

		<title2>Steel engraved portrait of Ariosto by R. Hart after R. Morghen after D. Dossi</title2>
		<creator>Morghen, Raphael</creator>
		<description>Portrait of the Italian poet Lodovico Ariosto (1474-1533). Ariosto's epic Orlando furioso (1516) was a favourite of Sir Walter Scott's from childhood onwards and exerted a lasting influence on his own verse. Over dinner with Captain Edward Cheney in Frascati on 1 May 1832, Scott claimed to read it once a year. At Edinburgh University he outraged his Greek professor by submitting an essay in which he argued that Ariosto was superior to Homer. While a college student, Scott took private Italian lessons to be able to read Ariosto, Tasso, and Boiardo in the original. Scott gave Edward Waverley, hero of his first novel (1814), much of his own love of Italian Romance. Francis Osbaldistone too in Rob Roy (1817) courts Diana Vernon by reading his translation of the first books of the Orlando furioso (ch. 16). Hart's engraving is based on an earlier engraving by Raphael Morghen (1809), which was itself freely derived from a 16th-century portrait by Dosso Dossi.</description>

		<creator>Wright, Joseph of Derby</creator>
		<description>Engraved portrait of the English engineer and industrialist Sir Richard Arkwright (1732-1792). Frances Crawford Kemble Arkwright set a number of Scott's lyrics to music, including 'Farewell to the Muse' (from The Pirate) and 'The Lay of Poor Louise' (from The Fair Maid of Perth). Scott described her as 'the most beautiful composer and delightful singer I ever heard without exception' (letter to Major Walter Scott, 20 May 1830). Scott was under the impression that she was the daughter-in-law of Sir Richard Arkwright, inventor of the spinning frame. In point of fact, her husband was Sir Richard's grandson Robert. Her father was the actor Stephen Kemble, brother of the better-known Charles Kemble, John Philip Kemble, and Sarah Kemble (later Mrs Siddons). The original portrait of Arkwright was painted in 1789-90 by Joseph Wright of Derby (or, at least, was produced by his studio).</description>

		<title2>Steel engraved portrait of Bacon by J. Posselwhite after a print by J. Houbraken</title2>
		<creator>Houbraken, Jacobus</creator>
		<description>Engraved portrait of the English philosopher, statesman, and essayist Sir Francis Bacon (1561-1626). Bacon is cited on a number of occasions by Sir Walter Scott, perhaps most notably in the Introduction to the Magnum Opus Edition of The Fortunes of Nigel (1831). Here Scott identifies the reign of James I and VI as a critical moment of transition from the Age of Chivalry to the Age of Reason: 'The hour was already arrived when Bacon was about to teach the world that they were no longer to reason from authority to fact, but to establish truth by advancing from fact to fact, till they fixed an indisputable authority, not from hypothesis, but from experiment.' A further significant citation occurs in 'The Two Drovers' (1827), where the judge at the trial of Robin Oig M'Combich quotes Bacon's view of revenge as 'a kind of wild, untutored justice'. Scott also cites Bacon's views on astrology in Guy Mannering (1815) and Letters on Demonology and Witchcraft (1830). The engraving by Posselwhite is based on an earlier line engraving by Jacobus Houbraken taken from a 17th-century portrait by an unknown artist.</description>

		<title1>Joanna Baillie</title1>
		<title2>Steel engraved portrait of Joanna Baillie by H. Robinson after a painting by Masquerier</title2>
		<creator>Masquerier, John James</creator>
		<description>Engraved portrait of the Scottish poet and dramatist Joanna Baillie (1762-1851). Sir Walter Scott was a great admirer of Joanna Baillie's blank verse Plays of the Passions, considering her 'the best dramatic writer whom Britain has produced since the days of Shakespeare and Massinger' (letter to Sarah Smith, 4 March 1808). He was first introduced to her at her Hampstead home in 1806, and the pair became lifelong friends and devoted correspondents. Scott found her 'the only writing lady with whose manners in society I have been very much delighted' (letter to Lady Abercorn, 18 September 1811). As a Trustee of Edinburgh Theatre, Scott played an active role in organizing a highly successful production of Baillie's The Family Legend and a revival of her De Montfort in 1810. Scott's own drama Halidon Hill began life as a contribution to Joanna Baillie's Collection of Poetical Miscellanies. When it grew too large for the anthology, it was replaced by a shorter dramatic sketch MacDuff's Cross. Baillie had earlier contributed verse to Scott's anthology English Minstrelsy (1810). The original portrait by Masquerier was painted in 1812. Concerning it, Scott wrote to Richard Heber: 'How has your friend Masquerier succeeded in painting Miss Baillie? if tolerably I must manage to get a copy cabinet size but poor M. has a heavey [sic] hand.'</description>

		<title2>Steel engraving of Sir Joseph Banks by C. E. Wagstaff after a painting by T. Phillips</title2>
		<creator>Phillips, Thomas</creator>
		<description>Engraved portrait of the naturalist and explorer Sir Joseph Banks (1743-1820). In a letter dated 10 February 1816, Scott asked Anna Jane Clephane to send him a humorous ballad that she had written about the Duke of Argyll's Factor. The Factor had reputedly sent the skeleton of a porpoise to Banks in the belief that it was a mermaid. When Banks attempted to disabuse him, the Factor opined that the distinguished naturalist was an 'auld blind doited deevil'. Scott relates a similar anecdote in a note to the Magnum Opus Edition of The Pirate (1831) recalling how a supposed sea-serpent was washed up on the shore of Shetland and sent to Banks for examination. Banks proclaimed it 'a basking shark', yet, Scott adds, 'it would seem that an animal so well known ought to have been immediately distinguished by the northern fishermen'. The original portrait by Thomas Phillips was painted in 1810.</description>

		<description>Engraved portrait of the divine, mathematician, and classicist the Reverend Isaac Barrow (1630-1677). In his much-read treatise Self-Help, Samuel Smiles cited Sir Walter Scott and Isaac Barrow as twin examples of successful men dismissed as dunces at school. Both are praised not only for their perseverance but for their cultivation of physical fitness. In Smiles's wake, the coupling of Scott and Barrow became a staple of self-help manuals.</description>

		<creator>Watts, George Frederick</creator>
		<description>Engraved portrait of the Utilitarian philosopher and political economist Jeremy Bentham (1748-1832). On 17 February 1823, Bentham wrote to Samuel Parr describing an engraving by Robert Bowyer of George Hayter's painting View of the Interior of the House of Lords during the Trial of Queen Caroline, 1820. Among the audience, Hayter had portrayed many public figures of the day, placing Bentham, to his dismay, next to Sir Walter Scott 'the servile poet and novelist'. Scott never mentioned Bentham by name but, both explicitly in his political pamphlets and implicitly in his novels, he attacked his projects for juridical reform which he feared would destroy national characteristics and traditions. When both men died in close proximity in 1832, obituarists presented them as figureheads of the two opposing currents of nineteenth-century thought: Utilitarianism and Romanticism. The original portrait by George Frederick Watts (not 'J. Watts' as indicated in the caption) was taken in 1837 from Bentham's 'Auto-Icon' (now on display at University College London).</description>

		<creator>Hudson, Thomas</creator>
		<description>Engraved portrait of the critic and classical scholar Richard Bentley (1662-1742). In Sir Walter Scott's novel Waverley (1814), the protagonist Edward Waverley is portrayed as a conceited, unreceptive scholar: '"I can read and understand a Latin author," said young Edward, with the self-confidence and rash reasoning of fifteen, "and Scaliger or Bentley could not do much more."' (ch. 3) Richard Bentley is perhaps England's greatest classical scholar. In his Memoir of Jonathan Swift (1814), Scott discusses Bentley's role in the controversy sparked by Sir William Temple's Ancient and Modern Learning which Swift satirized in The Battle of the Books (1704).</description>

		<description>Engraved portrait of the Scottish chemist and physicist Joseph Black (1728-1799). Black lived in the same building in College Wynd, Edinburgh, in which Sir Walter Scott was born. He has been credited with saving the infant Scott's life by informing his father that the child's nurse suffered from consumption. In Scott's novel Guy Mannering, Black is among the 'first literary characters of Scotland' to whom Counsellor Pleydell supplies Mannering with letters of introduction (ch. 10). The original portrait by Raeburn was painted ca. 1780 and the engraving by James Heath first published in 1800.</description>

		<description>Engraved portrait of Admiral Robert Blake (1599-1657). Robert Blake was appointed General at Sea by Cromwell in 1649 and is often described as the Father of the Royal Navy. In Sir Walter Scott's Peveril of the Peak (1823), the Countess of Derby recalls his unsuccessful siege of Peel Castle on the Isle of Man: 'When we had foiled various attempts upon the island by open force -- treason accomplished what Blake and Lawson, with their floating castles, had found too hazardous an enterprise -- a base rebel, whom we had nursed in our own bosoms, betrayed us to the enemy.' (ch. 5) The engraving by Mollison is taken after a 17th-century portrait by an unknown artist.</description>

		<description>Engraved portrait of the Italian writer Giovanni Boccaccio (1313-1375). The Decameron of Giovanni Boccaccio was a lifelong favourite of Sir Walter Scott and is frequently cited in the Waverley Novels. While a college student, Scott took private Italian lessons to be able to read Ariosto, Tasso, Boccaccio, and Boiardo in the original. He gave Edward Waverley, hero of his first novel (1814), much of his own love of Italian literature. The 17th-print by Van Dalen was taken from a portrait in the Royal Collection which is now attributed to Titian. It is now thought that the sitter is not Boccaccio but Jacopo Sannazaro.</description>

In an article on Moli̬re for the Foreign Quarterly Review in 1828, he also defends the playwright against Bossuet's charge of profanity. The original portrait by Hyacinthe Rigaud was painted in 1702.</description>

		<description>Engraved portrait of the political economist and linguist Sir John Bowring (1792-1872). Bowring visited Scott at Abbotsford in 1830. Scott thought him a 'clever' and 'very agreeable' man (letter to Robert Cadell, 23 April 1830). A description of the visit and a biographical sketch of Scott are included in Autobiographical Recollections of Sir John Bowring (1877). Bowring was also part of the Committee which organized the celebration of the centenary of Scott's birth in Melrose in 1871. The engraving by William Holl the Younger was first published in 1840; the original portrait was probably completed shortly beforehand.</description>

		<description>Engraved portrait of the Italian architect and painter Donato Bramante (1444-1514). Bramante is best known as the architect of St Peter's Basilica in Rome. Scott visited St Peter's in April 1832 while travelling on the Continent in an unsuccessful attempt to repair his health. His main interest lay, however, not in Bramante's architecture but in Canova's Cenotaph of the Stuarts erected in St Peter's with financial backing from King George IV. The 19th-century portrait by Alessandro D'Este is based on an unidentified earlier image.</description>

		<title1>George Buchanan: From a Picture by Francis Pourbus Senr. in the Possession of the Royal Society</title1>
		<title2>Steel engraved portrait of George Buchanan by E. Scriven after a picture by F. Pourbus the elder</title2>
		<creator>Pourbus, Frans the elder</creator>
		<description>Engraved portrait of the Scottish poet, historian and humanist scholar George Buchanan (1506-1582). In both his fictional and historical works, Sir Walter Scott drew extensively on Buchanan's Rerum Scoticarum Historia while treating its earlier chapters with some scepticism. Buchanan's histories and polemical treatises are a particularly important source for The Abbot (1820). Buchanan's role as tutor to King James VI and I is invoked in The Fortunes of Nigel (1822), especially his disapproval of the convention that a whipping boy (here Sir Mungo Malagrowther) suffer all punishments due to the King. There are further references to Buchanan in Waverley (where he is among the Baron of Bradwardine's favourite poets), The Monastery, and The Bride of Lammermoor. Buchanan was reputedly Scott's favourite Latin poet, although he found his Latin hymns less 'solemn and affecting' to his 'Gothic ear' than the Catholic liturgy (letter to Rev. George Crabbe, ca. January 1813).</description>

		<creator>Drouais, Fran̤ois Hubert</creator>
		<description>Engraved portrait of the French naturalist Georges Louis Leclerc, comte de Buffon (1707-1788). Sir Walter Scott's library at Abbotsford included an edition of Buffon's Histoire naturelle, g̩n̩rale et particuli̬re. Scott drew on it when likening the painter Dick Tinto to a sloth in chapter 1 of The Bride of Lammermoor (1819): 'In short, Dick Tinto's friends feared that he had acted like the animal called the sloth, which, heaving eaten up the last green leaf upon the tree where it has established itself, ends by tumbling down from the top, and dying of inanition.' The original portrait by Fran̤ois Hubert Drouais was painted in 1761.</description>

		<title2>Steel engraved portrait of Edmund Burke by C. E. Wagstaff after a painting by J. Reynolds</title2>
		<creator>Reynolds, Joshua, Sir (b.1723, d.1792)</creator>
		<description>Engraved portrait of the Irish statesman, philosopher and historian Edmund Burke (1729-1797). Burke exerted a great influence on Sir Walter Scott, both through his concept of the 'sublime' (expounded in A Philosophical Enquiry into the Origin of Our Ideas of the Sublime and Beautiful) and through his vision of an 'organic' society' (expounded in Reflections on the Revolution in France). In a letter to Henry Francis Scott, Younger of Harden, M.P. dated 10 January 1831, Scott praised 'the talents, the almost prophetic powers' of Burke: 'About 1792, when I was entering life, the admiration of the godlike system of the French Revolution was so rife, that only a few old-fashioned Jacobites and the like ventured to hint a preference for the land they lived in; or pretended to doubt that the new principles must be infused into our worn-out constitution. Burke appeared, and all the gibberish about the superior legislation of the French dissolved like an enchanted castle when the destined knight blows his horn before it.' The original portrait from the studio of Sir Joshua Reynolds was painted in 1767-69.</description>

		<title2>Steel engraved portrait of Burns by H. Robinson after a picture by A. Naysmith</title2>
		<creator>Nasmyth, Alexander (b.1758, d.1840)</creator>
		<description>Engraved portrait of the Scottish poet Robert Burns (1759-1796). For Sir Walter Scott, Robert Burns and Lord Byron were 'the most genuine poetical geniuses of my time, and half a century before me' (Journal, 9 February 1826). When asked by James Ballantyne how he ranked his own genius next to Burns, Scott replied: 'There is no comparison whatever -- we ought not to be named in the same day.' Scott met Burns only once at the age of fifteen in 1787 at Sciennes Hill House, Edinburgh, an event he frequently recalled. Besides copious quotations from Burns in his published works and letters, Scott included ballads collected by Burns in his Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border (1802-1803). He provided his son-in-law J. G. Lockhart with letters and reminiscences for his Life of Burns (1828) and approved of Lockhart's decision to gloss over the poet's perceived moral failings. Scott also helped organize a subscription for a monument to Burns in Dumfries (1814) and personally subscribed to the Burns Monument on Calton Hill, Edinburgh (1817). The original portrait of Burns was painted in 1787.</description>

		<creator>Dankerts, Cornelis</creator>
		<description>Engraved portrait of the French Protestant theologian John Calvin (1509-1564). Calvin exerted a profound influence on the Reformation in Scotland and on the development of Scottish Presbyterian doctrine. Sir Walter Scott was brought up in a strict Calvinist household but came to reject many of Calvin's creeds, notably predestinarianism, and to gravitate towards the Episcopal Church. There are references to Calvin in a number of the Waverley Novels, including Old Mortality (1816), Woodstock (1826) and, in particular, The Abbot (1820) where Roland Graeme calls his Huguenot grandmother 'as strict as Calvin himself' and Mary Queen of Scots criticizes the intolerance of the 'stern preachers of the Calvinistic heresy' (ch. 31).</description>

		<title1>Canova: From a Picture by Sir Thomas Lawrence in the Possession of the Abate Canova at Rome</title1>
		<title2>Steel engraved portrait of Canova by J. Posselwhite after a painting by T. Lawrence</title2>
		<creator>Lawrence, Thomas</creator>
		<description>Engraved portrait of the Italian sculptor Antonio Canova (1757-1822). Like most of his contemporaries, Sir Walter Scott considered Canova the foremost sculptor of his age. Visiting Paris in 1815, he admired the three Canovas commissioned by the Empress Josephine for the Malmaison (now in the Hermitage, St Petersburg). His Paul's Letters to his Kinsfolk (1816) records that he was 'particularly struck' by the Dancer with her Hand on her Hip. When in Rome in April 1832, the dying Scott most wished to see Canova's Cenotaph of the Stuarts erected in St Peter's at the expense of George IV. The following month he admired Canova's Venere Italica in the Palazzo Pitti in Florence. He also mentioned Canova's Venus Victrix in his Life of Napoleon Buonaparte (1827-28), commenting that Pauline Bonaparte's 'encouragement of the fine arts was so little limited by the ordinary ideas of decorum' that she permitted the sculptor to use her as the model. There is a single reference to Canova in the Waverly Novels. In chapter 12 of Saint Ronan's Well (1824) Valentine Bulmer declares that Clare Mowbray's pallor renders her more interesting: 'The last time I saw her, I thought she might have rivalled one of Canova's finest statues.' The original portrait by Sir Thomas Lawrence was painted in 1816.</description>

		<description>Engraved portrait of the English inventor and poet Edmund Cartwright (1743-1823). Edmund Cartwright, now primarily known as the inventor of the power loom, was also highly acclaimed as a poet during his lifetime. In his 'Essay on Imitations of the Ancient Ballad' (1830), Sir Walter Scott praises Cartwright's best-known poem 'Armine and Elvira' which contains 'some excellent poetry, expressed with unusual felicity'. He adds that he recalls meeting Cartwright in 'very early youth' at the house of his grandfather John Rutherford, and that 'he was the first living poet I recollect to have seen'. The original portrait is by fellow inventor Robert Fulton (1765-1815).</description>

Catherine's foreign policy is discussed in Sir Walter Scott's The Life of Napoleon Buonaparte (1827-28), particularly with respect to the partition of Poland and the principle of 'armed neutrality'. The original portrait was painted by Alexander Roslin in 1777-78, and the print by Caroline Watson was published in 1788.</description>

		<title1>Cervantes. After the Spanish print engraved by D. F. Selma</title1>
		<title2>Steel engraved portrait of Cervantes by E. Mackenzie after a print by F. Selma</title2>
		<creator>Carnicero Mancio, Antonio</creator>
		<description>Engraved portrait of the Spanish writer Miguel de Cervantes Saavedra (1547-1616), author of Don Quixote. Over dinner with Captain Edward Cheney in Frascati on 1 May 1832, Scott claimed that it was Cervantes who first inspired in him the desire to excel in fiction. Indeed in the opening section of his first novel Waverley (1814), Scott hails Cervantes as his most significant predecessor while underlining his own innovations on his model: 'From the minuteness with which I have traced Waverley's pursuits,and the bias which these unavoidably communicated to his imagination, the reader may perhaps anticipate, in the following tale, an imitation of the romance of Cervantes. But he will do my prudence injustice in the supposition. My intention is not to follow the steps of that inimitable author, in describing such total perversion of intellect as misconstrues the objects actually presented to the senses, but that more common aberration from sound judgment, which apprehends occurrences indeed in their reality, but communicates to them a tincture of its own romantic tone and colouring.' (ch. 5) While studying at Edinburgh University Scott acquired sufficient Spanish to read Cervantes in the original. His works are saturated with references to Don Quixote and the Novelas ejemplares. The Tales of a Landlord each bear an epitaph from Don Quixote. The 'Introductory Epistle' to The Monastery (1820) cites Don Quixote as an example of the dangers of anonymous authorship, inspiring, like Scott's own novels, sequels from unscrupulous rivals. In the 'Introductory Address' to Count Robert of Paris and Castle Dangerous (1832), Scott's last published works, Scott again cites Cervantes's self-defence against critics who highlighted minor inconsistencies and loose ends in his narrative. The importance of Cervantes is also repeatedly acknowledged in Lives of the Novelists (1821-24) and the 'Essay on Chivalry' (1818). The original engraving by Fernando Selma from a design by Antonio Carnicero Mancio was first published in 1780.</description>

		<title1>Dr. Chalmers</title1>

		<creator>Lockhart, John Gibson</creator>
		<description>Engraved portrait of the Rev. Thomas Chalmers, founding father of the Free Church of Scotland. James Ballantyne records that Sir Walter Scott abandoned his habitual indifference to praise when he heard that his novels had been lauded in public by Chalmers. Scott declared that 'to have produced any effect upon the mind of such a man as Dr. Chalmers is indeed something to be proud of', for Chalmers was 'a man of the truest genius'. Only one encounter between Scott and Chalmers has been recorded. At the Annual Meeting of the School of Arts on 1 June 1824 Chalmers moved the approval of the Annual Report, expressing an essentially paternalistic vision of the relationship between the school and its working-class pupils. Scott seconded the motion, warmly applauding the principles underpinning Chalmers's speech. See William Hanna, Memoirs of the Life and Writings of Thomas Chalmers (New York: Harper, 1857), vol. III, pp. 37-38. The initials P.M. on the plate stand for Peter Morris, the pseudonym that Lockhart adopted when writing Peter's Letters to His Kinsfolk (1819).</description>

		<creator>Cotes, Francis</creator>
		<description>Engraved portrait of the British architect Sir William Chambers (1723-1796). Chambers is best known as the architect of Somerset House, London (1776-96). Reviewing James Boaden's Memoirs of the Life of John Philip Kemble for the Quarterly Review in June 1826, Sir Walter Scott recalled an incident at the Annual Dinner of the Royal Academy in Somerset House, which he had attended with Kemble. At the height of the meal, a massive chandelier had become partially dislodged, and disaster had been narrowly averted: 'If the absolute fall of the chandelier had taken place, it would have tried Chambers's architecture with a vengeance, and beyond a doubt must have penetrated through the floor to the very cellars of the building, carrying with it princes, dukes, painters, poets, musicians, amateurs -- and critics.' The original portrait was painted in 1764 by Francis Cotes.</description>

		<creator>Holbein, Hans the younger</creator>
		<description>Engraved portrait of Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor (1500-1558). When, in chapter 6 of Sir Walter Scott's Guy Mannering (1815) Counsellor Pleydell abdicates the role of monarch in the game of High Jinks, he declares: 'Nay, then, sink state and perish sovereignty! for, like a second Charles V, we will abdicate, and seek in the private shades of life those pleasures which are denied to a throne.' In 1556 Charles V abdicated the thrones of the Holy Roman Empire, Spain, Naples, Sicily, the Burgundian Netherlands, and the Spanish colonies in America. Dividing his realms between his son Philip and his brother Ferdinand, he retired to a monastery. According to Scott's The Life of Napoleon Buonaparte (1827-28), the French Emperor also likened his own abdication to that of Charles V.</description>

		<title1>Lord Chatham: From a Print by E. Fisher after a Picture by R. Brompton</title1>
		<title2>Steel engraved portrait of Lord Chatham by W. Holl from a picture by E. Brompton</title2>
		<creator>Brompton, Richard</creator>
		<description>Engraved portrait of the British statesman William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham (1708-1778) ('Pitt the Elder'). Sir Walter Scott records in his Journal that on 24 May 1828 the former Prime Minister Henry Addington, 1st Viscount Sidmouth showed him correspondence between Pitt the Elder and Anthony Addington (the Pitt family's physician and Sidmouth's father). Scott finds that Pitt's 'handwriting is strong and bold, and his expressions short and manly'. He notes many 'intimations of his partiality' for his son William and Pitt's concern for William's mania to copy him in all things. Comparing the correspondence of the two William Pitts, Scott reflects that Pitt the Younger lacked the 'lofty ideas' of his father, as evidenced in his very handwriting. He particularly contrasts Pitt the Elder's vigorous prosecution of war with France with Pitt the Younger's pacific instincts and tendency to underfund the armed forces, a point that Scott has previously made in his Life of Napoleon Buonaparte (1827-28). In 'The Highland Widow' (1827) Chatham is also praised for entrusting the defence of the colonies to Highlanders 'who, until his time, had been the objects of doubt, fear, and suspicion, on the part of each successive administration'. The original portrait by Brompton was painted in 1772 and the print made by Edward Fisher shortly afterwards.</description>

		<title1>Chaucer. From a Limning in Occleve's Poems in the British Museum</title1>
		<title2>Steel engraved portrait of Chaucer by J. Thomson after Occleve</title2>
		<creator>Occleve</creator>
		<description>Engraved portrait of the English poet Geoffrey Chaucer (d. 1400). 'Of all Chaucer's multifarious powers', wrote Sir Walter Scott in his Life of Dryden (1808), 'none is more wonderful than the humour with which he touched upon natural frailty, and the truth with which he describes the inward feelings of the human heart'. Chaucer is frequently cited throughout Scott's works, particularly as an authoritative source on medieval life and manners. In Peveril of the Peak (ch. 21) and Woodstock (ch. 16), Scott introduces Chaucer enthusiasts who lament the neglect into which the poet has fallen. Chaucer's unpopularity continued into Scott's day, his project of a hundred-volume edition of the British poets foundering upon his insistence that it begin with Chaucer. A correspondent, Anna Seward, even wrote that Dryden, Spencer, and Chaucer seems to her 'overpraised' and that 'not one of them equals yourself or Southey' (29 January 1807). Scott replied that 'My admiration of Chaucer Spenser and Dryden does not blind me to their faults for I see the coarsness [sic] of the first the tediousness occasiond [sic] by the continued allegory of the second and the inequalities of the last but my dear Miss Seward "in these days were giants in the land" and we are but dwarfs beside them' (20 February 1807). The engraving by Thomson is taken after an illuminated portrait of Chaucer in a manuscript of Thomas Occleve's Regiment of Princes (1412).</description>

		<title1>Lord Clarendon: From the Picture in the Bodleian Library, Oxford</title1>
		<title2>Steel engraved portrait of Lord Clarendon by C. E. Wagstaff</title2>
		<creator>Lely, Peter</creator>
		<description>Engraved portrait of the English politician and historian Edward Hyde, Earl of Clarendon. Sir Walter Scott frequently cited Clarendon's History of the Rebellion and Civil Wars in England. It proved an invaluable source for his Tales of a Grandfather, Second Series (1829) and for his novels of 17th-century England, The Fortunes of Nigel (1822), Peveril of the Peak (1823), and Woodstock (1826). In a letter of 21 November 1821, Scott recommended that his son Charles read Clarendon: '[H]is stile [sic] is a little long-winded but on the other hand his Characters may match those of the Ancient historians and one thinks they would know the very men if you were to meet them in society: few English writers have the same precision either in describing the actors in great scenes or the actions which they performed. He was you are aware himself deeply engaged in the scenes which he describes and therefore mentions them with the individual feeling and sometimes doubtless with the partiality of a partizan [sic]. Yet I think he is on the whole a fair writer for though he always endeavours to excuse King Chas. yet he points out his mistakes and errors which certainly were neither few nor of slight consequence.' The engraving by Wagstaff is from an original portrait by Sir Peter Lely.</description>

		<title2>Engraved portrait of John Clerk by J. Stewart</title2>
		<creator>Lockhart, John Gibson</creator>
		<description>Engraved portraits of Scottish judge John Clerk, Lord Eldin (1757-1832). Clerk was a colleague of Sir Walter Scott at the Scottish Bar and was appointed to the Bench as Lord Eldin in 1823. He was known as a great connoisseur and collector of art. Scott consulted him as to the authenticity of a painting purporting to show the head of Mary Queen of Scots following her execution (see letter to Robert Pitcairn, 18 September 1822). Eldin was also a fellow antiquarian and co-member of the Bannatyne Club. Lord Eldin's father, Sir John Clerk of Eldin, provided some of the inspiration for the antiquarian Jonathan Oldbuck in Scott's The Antiquary (1816) and owned Lasswade Cottage where Scott lived between 1798 and 1803. Lord Eldin's younger brother William, another advocate, was an intimate friend of Scott's. The initials P.M. on the plate stand for Peter Morris, the pseudonym that Lockhart adopted when writing Peter's Letters to His Kinsfolk (1819). In a letter to Lockhart of 23 March 1819 Scott particularly praised his character sketch of Lord Eldin.</description>

		<description>Engraved portrait of the English judge and writer on law Sir Edward Coke (1552-1634). One of the most important jurists in English history, Coke is best-known for his Institutes of the Laws of England (1628-44). In chapter 8 of Sir Walter Scott's Rob Roy (1818), Justice Inglewood is reconciled to his office when his clerk, Joseph Jobson, reminds him of Coke's assertion that 'the whole Christian world hath not the like of it, so it be duly executed'. Scott also discusses Coke's unhappy marriage to Lady Elizabeth Hatton and their dispute over their daughter's marriage in a footnote to his edition of Secret History of the Court of James the First (1811). The engraving by Posselwhite is from an original portrait by Cornelius Janssen van Ceulen (1593-1661).</description>

		<description>Engraved portrait of the French statesman Jean Baptiste Colbert (1619-1683). Colbert served as Louis XIV's minister of finance from 1665 to 1683 and is credited with saving the nation from bankruptcy. In Tales of a Grandfather, Fourth Series (1831), Scott praises his tolerant attitude to France's Protestant minority. He argues that Colbert's death deprived the Protestants of a powerful protector, exposing them to the persecutions of the chancellor Michel le Tellier and his son Louvois, and leading directly to the Revocation of the Edict of Nantes (1685). The original portrait by Pierre Mignard was painted in 1667.</description>

		<creator>Dance-Holland, Nathaniel</creator>
		<description>Engraved portrait of the British explorer James Cook (1728-1779). Sir Walter Scott was named as literary executor to the poetess Anna Seward (1742-1809) and prepared a posthumous edition of her works (1810). In a biographical preface he recalled the immense popularity of her 'Elegy on Captain Cook' (1780). The poem was 'dictated by those feelings of admiration and gratitude, which in common with Europe at large, Miss Seward felt for the firm and benevolent character of the dauntless navigator, and for his tragical destiny'. The original portrait by Nathaniel Dance-Holland was painted in 1776.</description>

		<title1>Corneille: From an Original Picture by C. Lebrun in the Possession of the Institute of France</title1>
		<title2>Steel engraved portrait of Corneille by T. Woolnoth from a picture by C. Le Brun</title2>
		<creator>Le Brun, Charles</creator>
		<description>Engraved portrait of the French dramatist Pierre Corneille (1606-1684). In his 'Essay on the Drama' (1819) Scott credited Corneille with overcoming the arbitrary restrictions imposed on French Classical Drama by the observance of the Aristotelian unities of time, place, and action. Despite being 'surrounded by the worst possible models', he 'vanquished the taste of his age, the competition of his rivals, and the envy of Richelieu'. Scott nonetheless regrets that in his own 'Essay on Dramatic Poetry', Corneille helped to impose the observance of the unities on future generations of French dramatists, even though they had at times forced him to 'violate the rules of probability and common sense'. In his essay on 'Moli̬re' (1828), Scott considered the differences between the French classical tragedy of Corneille and Racine and the English tragedy of Shakespeare, and analysed the radically differing tastes of French and English audiences. In his The Life of Napoleon Bonaparte (1827-28), Scott attributed Napoleon's preference for Racine and Corneille over Voltaire to the fact that 'they wrote their immortal works for the meridian of a court, and at the command of the most monarchical of monarchs, Louis XIV'. Unlike Voltaire, their masterpieces contain 'nothing that can wound the ear of the most sensitive sovereign'. Corneille is, with Boileau, one of the authors for whom Frank Osbaldistone neglects his commercial studies in chapter 1 of Rob Roy (1818). The original portrait by Charles LeBrun was painted in 1647.</description>

		<title2>Steel engraved portrait of Correggio by H. Meyer after a self-portrait</title2>
		<creator>Correggio</creator>
		<description>Engraved portrait of the Italian artist Correggio (1489?-1534). On first viewing Raphael's 'St Cecilia' at Bologna, Correggio exclaimed 'Anch'io son' pittore' ('I too am a painter!'). Sir Walter Scott quoted Correggio's words in a letter to Sir George Beaumont, dated 28 August 1825, to describe his passion for planning the buildings and plantations of his Abbotsford estate. In his Life of Napoleon Buonaparte (1827-28), Scott also describes how the peace treaty between the French general and the Duke of Parma (1796) stipulated for the delivery to France of twenty masterpieces from the Duke's collections, including Correggio's 'St Jerome'. The Duke offered two million 'livres' in place of the Correggio, but Napoleon replied that the millions would soon be spent, whereas the painting would be an ornament to Paris for ages, and would inspire future masterpieces.</description>

		<title1>Cortez: From a Picture in the Florence Gallery</title1>
		<title2>Steel engraved portrait of Cortes by W. Holl</title2>
		<creator>Unknown</creator>
		<description>Engraved portrait of Hernan Cort̩s (1485-1547), conqueror of Mexico. In Letters on Demonology and Witchcraft (1830), Scott cites an episode in the life of the conquistador Hernan Cort̩s (or Cort̩z) as an instance of the 'infectious character of superstition'. According to Bernal Diaz del Castillo's Historia verdadera de la Nueva Espana, Cort̩s did not himself see a vision of Saint Iago on a white horse which appeared to his soldiers and urged them on to a victory against great odds. Instead he saw a cavalier, named Francisco de Morla, mounted on a chestnut horse. Rather than concluding, however, that the vision was a figment of the collective imagination, Cort̩s exclaimed: 'Sinner that I am, what am I that I should have beheld the blessed apostle!' There are further references to Cort̩s in Rokeby (1813) and The Pirate (1821). In canto I, stanza 12 of the former Bertram Risingham describes the Battle of Marston Moor. If he had led such valiant men, he exclaims, he would not have sought 'El Dorados in the sky' but would have outstripped the conquests of Cort̩s and Pizarro (lines 19-28). In chapter 4 of The Pirate, Scott remarks that the Scottish plough that Triptolemus Yellowly seeks attempts to introduce to Shetland would seem stranger to a modern Scottish farmer 'than the corslets and casques of the soldiers of Cortes might seem to a regiment of our soldiers'. The engraving is taken after a portrait by an unknown artist in the Galleria degli Uffizi, Florence.</description>

		<title1>Cowper: From a Picture in the Possession of the Publisher</title1>
		<title2>Steel engraved portrait of William Cowper by W. Holl</title2>
		<creator>Abbott, Lemuel Francis</creator>
		<description>Engraved portrait of the English poet William Cowper (1731-1800). In both his published works and private correspondence, Sir Walter Scott frequently quoted Cowper's poetry, particularly 'The Task' which is cited in both The Heart of Mid-Lothian (1818, ch. 1) and Saint Ronan's Well (1823, ch. 15). According to Basil Hall's Fragments of Voyages and Travels (1834), when sailing from Portsmouth Harbour in 1831, Scott asked to be shown the spot where the HMS Royal George was accidentally sunk. Scott then quoted the following lines from Cowper's 'Loss of the Royal George': 'His sword was in its sheath | His fingers held the pen, | Where Kempenfield went down | With twice four hundred men.' The engraving is derived from a portrait by Lemuel Francis Abbott (1792) probably via an earlier engraving by Henry Hoppner Meyer (1816).</description>

		<title1>Cranmer: From an Original Picture in the Collection at Lambeth Palace</title1>
		<title2>Steel engraved portrait of Thomas Cranmer by W. Holl</title2>
		<creator>Unknown</creator>
		<description>Engraved portrait of Thomas Cranmer (1489-1556), Archbishop of Canterbury and Protestant theologian. Although there appears to be no direct reference to Thomas Cranmer in Scott's works, he is significant as author of The Book of Common Prayer, attempts to introduce which into Scotland gave birth to the Covenanting movement. In Old Mortality (1816) the hero Henry Morton when awaiting death instinctively recites the 'petition for deliverance and for composure of spirit which is to be found in the Book of Common Prayer of the Church of England' (ch. 33). This is taken as evidence of treason to the Covenanting cause, and overcomes Ephraim MacBriar's reluctance to have him executed. The engraving is derived ultimately from a 16th-century woodcut by an unknown artist.</description>

		<creator>Walker, Robert</creator>
		<description>Engraved portrait of the English statesman Oliver Cromwell (1599-1658). Cromwell figures prominently in Sir Walter Scott's novel Woodstock (1826), which revolves around the escape of King Charles II following his decisive defeat by Cromwell at the Battle of Worcester (3 September 1651). Cromwell also features in further works on the religious and civil conflicts of the sixteenth century, including Rokeby (1813) and Peveril of the Peak (1823). His occupation of Scotland is described in Tales of a Grandfather, Second Series (1829). The original portrait by Robert Walker was painted ca. 1649.</description>

		<creator>Reynolds, Joshua, Sir (b.1723, d.1792)</creator>
		<description>Engraved vignette portrait of Henry Frederick, Duke of Cumberland (1745-1790). Henry Frederick, Duke of Cumberland and Strathearn, was the sixth child of Frederick, Prince of Wales and Augusta of Saxe-Gotha, and a younger brother of George III. He acceded to the Duchy in 1766, following the death of Prince William Augustus, known as 'Butcher Cumberland' for his persecution of the Jacobites following their defeat at Culloden. Sir Walter Scott portrays William Augustus in Waverley (1814) and Redgauntlet (1824). There appears to be no mention, however, of Henry Frederick in Scott's writings, although Scott's son Walter served under his successor Prince Ernest Augustus, Duke of Cumberland and Teviotdale.</description>

		<description>Engraved portrait of the French naturalist and zoologist Georges, Baron Cuvier (1769-1832). Sir Walter Scott's biographer and son-in-law J. G. Lockhart wrote that the deaths of Goethe, Scott, and Cuvier in 1832 saw Germany, Britain, and France simultaneously mourning over their greatest intellects, an observation made by a number of obituarists. Ralph Waldo Emerson in English Traits also noted erroneously that Scott and Cuvier shared the same date of birth, a mistake frequently repeated by later writers. The original portrait may be a drawing by Fran̤ois-Joseph Heim, now in the Louvre.</description>

		<title1>Dante Alighieri: From a Print by Raffaelle Morghen after a Picture by Tofanelli</title1>
		<title2>Steel engraved portrait of Dante by C. E. Wagstaff after an original picture by Tofanelli</title2>
		<creator>Tofanelli, Stefano</creator>
		<description>Engraved portrait of the Italian poet Dante Alighieri (1265-1321). While a college student, Scott took private Italian lessons to be able to read Ariosto, Tasso, Boiardo, and Dante in the original. His admiration for Dante, however, was always qualified. Discussing the Inferno with Anna Seward, Scott complained that 'the plan appeared to him unhappy; the personal malignity and strange mode of revenge presumptuous and uninteresting'. In Italy in 1832, he told Captain Edward Cheney that he found Dante too obscure and difficult and thought it 'mortifying that Dante seemed to think nobody worth being sent to hell but his own Italians, whereas other people had every bit as great rogues in their families, whose misdeeds were suffered to pass with impunity'. Scott had forgotten that Dante had damned his own ancestor, the wizard Michael Scott. In chapter 12 of Rob Roy (1817), Diana Vernon seeks a pretext for a private interview with Frank Osbaldistone and asks for help deciphering a 'difficult passage' in the 'obscure Florentine's Divine Comedy. Frank's rival Rashleigh offers to accompany them as he is 'something better skilled [...] at tracking the sense of Dante through the metaphors and elisions of his wild and gloomy poem'. The print is derived from an earlier engraving by Raphael Morghen taken from a portrait by Stefano Tofanelli (1752-1812).</description>

		<creator>Lawrence, Thomas</creator>
		<description>Engraved portrait of the British scientist, inventor, and poet Sir Humphry Davy (1778-1829). Sir Walter Scott and Davy were fellow guests of William Wordsworth's at Dove Cottage, Grasemere, in August 1805. Scott 'liked him excessively' and was 'particularly delighted with the total absence of pedantry which has always appeared to me the test of true genius' (letter to Jane Kerr Apreece, 2 April 1811). Davy later made two visits to Scott at Abbotsford in 1820 and 1823. In 1812 Davy had become a member of Scott's extended family by marrying his widowed cousin Jane Kerr Apreece. As a favour to her Scott wrote a review of Davy's Salmoniana for the Quarterly Review in 1828. The original portrait by Sir Thomas Lawrence was painted ca. 1821.</description>

		<creator>Taylor, Jeremiah</creator>
		<description>Engraved portrait of the English author Daniel Defoe (1661?-1731). According to John Robert Moore, it was Sir Walter Scott 'more than any other individual [...] who raised Defoe from obscurity in literary history to his modern position as a master of prose fiction' ('Defoe and Scott', PMLA, 56 (1941), 710-35). Scott edited the first collection of Defoe's novels for the Ballantyne Press (1809-10) and assembled many of his anonymous tracts in his edition of the Somers Tracts (1809-15). For Miscellaneous Prose Works of Sir Walter Scott (1827), Scott added extensive critical remarks to the biographical sketch co-written with John Ballantyne that preceded his edition of Defoe's novels. This influential essay ascribed Defoe's appeal to 'the unequalled dexterity with which our author has given an appearance of REALITY to the incidents which he narrates'. Defoe's influence on Scott has been observed particularly in Old Mortality (1816), Rob Roy (1817), and The Pirate (1821). The engraving is derived from a 1703 print by Michael Vandergucht (1660-1725) itself engraved from a painting by Jeremiah Taylor (fl. 1700-50).</description>

		<description>Engraved portrait of the English sailor Sir Francis Drake (1540?-1596). In a footnote to chapter 7 of the Magnum Opus edition of Kenilworth (1831), Scott writes that 'Sir Francis Drake, Morgan, and many a bold buccaneer of those days, were, in fact, little better than pirates'. Indeed, in The Pirate (1821) Bunce laments that pirates can no longer achieve respectability whereas 'Old Drake, in Queen Bess's time, could plunder Peru and Mexico without a line of commission to shew for it, and blessed be her memory, he was knighted for it on his return' (vol, III, ch. 4). In the same novel, tales of Drake tempt Mordaunt Mertoun to join Captain Cleveland's pirate crew (I, 9).</description>

		<creator>Hudson, Thomas</creator>
		<description>Engraved portrait of the English poet John Dryden (1631-1700). In 1808, Scott published the first complete and uniform edition of Dryden's works which is still regarded as one of the best-edited projects in English. Scott immersed himself in the literary and controversial writings of Dryden's age, and his edition provides a vivid picture of Restoration England. It is prefaced by a 'Life of Dryden' in which Scott praises the poet for the 'power of ratiocination, of investigating, discovering, and appreciating that which is really excellent [...] accompanied with the necessary command of fanciful illustration and elegant expression'. Scott placed Dryden behind only Shakespeare and Milton, but argued that he excelled both in versatility and had 'no equal' as a lyric poet. No other writer is quoted as frequently as Dryden in Scott's published works. Dryden's dramas also influenced Scott's own portrayal of seventeenth-century England, particularly Absalom and Achitopel, which informs the portrayal of Charles II and his favourite Buckingham in Peveril of the Peak (1823).</description>

		<creator>Williams, R.</creator>
		<description>Engraved portrait of the Scottish soldier and nobleman John Graham of Claverhouse, Viscount Dundee (1648-1689). Claverhouse's campaign against the Covenanters is the subject of Sir Walter Scott's Old Mortality (1816). In a footnote to the Magnum Opus edition of the novel (1830), Scott writes: 'This remarkable person united the seemingly inconsistent qualities of courage and cruelty, a disinterested and devoted loyalty to his prince, with a disregard of the rights of his fellow-subjects. He was the unscrupulous agent of the Scottish Privy Council in executing the merciless severities of the government in Scotland during the reigns of Charles II. and James II.; but he redeemed his character by the zeal with which he asserted the cause of the latter monarch after the Revolution, the military skill with which he supported it at the battle of Killiecrankie, and by his own death in the arms of victory.' Scott was fascinated by the figure of Claverhouse, whom he believed had been traduced by Presbyterian historians, and displayed a portrait of him in his study at Castle Street, Edinburgh. Claverhouse is also portrayed in 'Wandering Willie's Tale' (1824) and in the song 'Bonnie Dundee' in Scott's play The Doom of Devorgoil (1830).</description>

		<description>Engraved portrait of Elizabeth I, Queen of England (1533-1603). The plot of Sir Walter Scott's novel Kenilworth (1821) centres around the ill-fated secret marriage of Queen Elizabeth I's favourite, the Earl of Leicester to Amy Robsart. Elizabeth figures prominently in the novel, particularly during the celebrations held in her honour at Kenilworth Castle. Elizabeth also features as a supporter of the Protestant cause in Scotland in The Monastery and The Abbot (1820). Her relations with Mary Queen of Scots are discussed in the latter novel and, at length, in Tales of a Grandfather, Second Series (1829). The engraving is probably derived from a portrait by Isaac Oliver.</description>

		<creator>Holbein, Hans the younger</creator>
		<description>Engraved portrait of the Dutch humanist Erasmus (d. 1536). There are a number of references to and borrowings from Erasmus in Sir Walter Scott's works. In The Antiquary (1815), Jonathan Oldbuck's German ancestor Aldobrand has conversed with Erasmus (ch. 11). In Kenilworth (1821), the pedantic schoolmaster Erasmus Holiday derives his name 'partly from his father having been the son of a renowned washerwoman, who had held that great scholar in clean linen all the while he was at Oxford' and partly due to 'the secret presentiment of his mother's mind that, in the babe to be christened, was a hidden genius, which should one day lead him to rival the fame of the great scholar of Amsterdam' (ch. 9). In Anne of Geierstein (1829), the description of a German tavern and of 15th-century Germany manners is derived, without acknowledgment, from Erasmus's dialogue Diversoria (ch. 19). There is a further quotation from Diversoria in chapter 1 of Saint Ronan's Well (1823). The engraving by Scriven is taken from a portrait by Georg Pencz which is itself, however, an enlargement of a portrait by Hans Holbein the Younger.</description>

		<description>Engraved portrait of the lawyer and Whig politician Baron Thomas Erskine (1750-1823). Erskine was Lord Chancellor from 1806 to 1807. In his Journal for 20 April 1829, Sir Walter Scott describes him as 'positively mad', recalling 'him tell a cock-and-a-bull story of having seen the ghost of his father's servant, John Burnet, with as much sincerity as if he believed every word he was saying'. Scott refers to the same episode in slightly more measured terms in a letter to Lady Abercorn (13 September 1822), describing Lord Londonderry 'as the only man I ever heard affirm that he had seen an apparition excepting Lord Erskine a person of so flighty a character that one does not wonder at anything he could say'. Scott credited Erskine with a portion of his family's wit but of a 'moody and maddish' kind. He acknowledged, however, that 'I never saw him in his best days' (Journal, 20 April 1829). The original portrait by John Hoppner was painted in 1787 or 1788.</description>

		<title1>F̩n̩lon [sic]: From the Original Picture by Vivien in the Collection at the Louvre</title1>
		<title2>Steel engraved portrait of F̩nelon by J. Thomson after a painting by Vivien</title2>
		<creator>Vivien, Joseph</creator>
		<description>Engraved portrait of the French theologian and novelist Francois de Salignac de la Mothe-F̩nelon (1651-1715). In his Introduction to the Magnum Opus edition of Quentin Durward (1831), Sir Walter Scott quotes F̩nelon's description of the paranoid solitude of the tyrant Pygmalion in Book 3 of Les Aventures de T̩l̩maque (1699). In common with most scholars, Sir Walter Scott believes that in Pygmalion F̩nelon intended to portray Louis XI of France. Scott's own portrayal of Louis in Quentin Durward owes much to F̩nelon's Pygmalion.</description>

		<title2>Steel engraved portrait of John Flaxman by R. Woodman after a painting by John Jackson</title2>
		<creator>Jackson, John</creator>
		<description>Engraved portrait of the English sculptor and designer John Flaxman (1755-1826). Sir Walter Scott's friend George Ellis suggested that he invite Flaxman to illustrate The Lay of the Last Minstrel (1805). Scott feared, however, that Flaxman's style was 'too classical to stoop to body forth my Gothic Borderers' and that there would be 'some risk of their resembling the antique of Homer's heroes, rather than the iron race of Salvator' (letter of 21 August 1804). Scott had, in fact, already arranged to have the volume illustrated by engravings from paintings by John James Masquerier. Flaxman himself was no admirer of Scott. According to Crabb Robinson's diary, he remarked to Samuel Rogers that 'his works have in no respect tended to improve the moral condition of mankind'. The original portrait by John Jackson was painted in the mid-1820s.</description>

		<title1>The Right Hon.ble Chas. James Fox: Principal Secretary of State for the Foreign Department andcandcandc</title1>
		<title2>Engraved portrait by James Ogbourne</title2>
		<creator>Ogbourne, James</creator>
		<description>Engraved vignette portrait of the British statesman Charles James Fox (1749-1806). When, in 1806, Scott's political patron Henry Dundas, 1st Viscount Melville, was acquitted of misappropriation of public funds, Sir Walter Scott composed a celebratory song which mocked Melville's Whig opponents Samuel Whitbread and Charles James Fox: 'But the Brewer we'll hoax, | Tallyho to the Fox, | And drink MELVILLE for ever, as long as we live!' ('Health to Lord Melville', lines 82-84). These lines, composed when Fox was gravely ill, gave serious offence to his supporters and cost Scott the friendship of Dugald Stewart and the Countess of Rosslyn. Scott made partial amends by praising Fox's patriotism in the Introduction to Canto I of Marmion (1808): 'When Europe crouch'd to France's yoke, | And Austria bent, and Prussia broke, | And the firm Russian's purpose brave, | Was barter'd by a timorous slave, | Even then dishonour's peace he spurn'd, | The sullied olive-branch return'd, | Stood for his country's glory fast, | And nail'd her colours to the mast!' (lines 154-161). In the Introduction to the 1830 edition of Marmion, Scott recalls his reluctance to appeal to Fox to sort out a clerical error jeopardizing his appointment as Principal Clerk to the Court of Session. He feared that it might appear an expression of 'political opinions different from those which I have always professed', although 'in his private capacity, there is no man to whom I would have been more proud to owe an obligation'. Scott was also told that Fox admired his Lay of the Last Minstrel (1805), and wrote: 'Although my Tory principles prevent my coinciding with his political opinions, I am very proud of his approbation in a literary sense' (letter to George Ellis, 26 May 1805). The engraving may derive from a painting by John Raphael Smith.</description>

		<title2>Steel engraved portrait of Frederick II of Prussia by E. Scriven from a picture by Carlo Vanloo</title2>
		<creator>Loo, Carle van</creator>
		<description>Engraved portrait of Frederick II ('the Great'), King of Prussia (1712-1786). In Munich in May 1832, Sir Walter Scott admired the coat, pistols, saddle and bridle of Frederick the Great. He had earlier advised his soldier son Walter to read Frederick's instructions to light troops as 'he was the first who reduced that important part of an army to system and principle' (letter of 27 June 1820). In his Life of Napoleon Buonaparte (1827-28), Scott describes the King of Prussia and Tsar of Russia swearing to liberate Germany on Frederick the Great's tomb. In Paul's Letters to His Kinsfolk (1815), he unfavourably compares Napoleon who plundered the artistic treasures of Dresden with Frederick who was content to admire them.</description>

		<title1>George II</title1>
		<title2>Engraved portrait of George II by S. F. Ravenet probably after T. Worlidge</title2>
		<creator>Worlidge, Thomas</creator>
		<description>Engraved profile portrait of George II, King of Great Britain (1683-1760). Sir Walter Scott's first novel Waverley (1814) is set during the Jacobite Rebellion of 1745-46 which sought to place Charles Edward Stewart on the British throne in place of the Hanoverian George II. The hero, Edward Waverley, is arrested on a charge of 'levying war against the king, the highest delinquency of which a subject can be guilty' (ch. 31). A further fictional rebellion against George II is described in Redgauntlet (1824). Here the ultimate failure of the Jacobite cause is proved by the reading of George II's personal orders to let the conspirators return in peace to the Continent (ch. 23). The Jacobite Rebellions are also described in Tales of a Grandfather, Third Series (1829), where Scott terms Georges I and II 'men of honour, courage, and good sense; but, being born and educated foreigners [...] strangers to the peculiar character, no less than to the very complicated form of government, of the country over which they were called by Providence to reign'. Despite Scott's insistence on George II's 'good sense', there are references in The Heart of Mid-Lothian (1818) to his notorious temper. Miss Damahoy has heard 'that King George flang his periwig in the fire when he heard o' the Porteous mob', kicked Sir Robert Walpole, and, according to Bartholomew Saddletree 'was for kicking the Duke of Argylle too'. Miss Damahoy concludes that 'he might keep mair wit in his anger' (ch. 23). In the same novel Jeanie Deans successfully pleads with Queen Caroline to intercede with George II to pardon her sister Effie. The engraving by Ravenet is probably derived from a 1753 painting by Thomas Worlidge.</description>

		<title1>His Majesty King George the IV: Born August 12 1762</title1>
		<title2>Steel engraved portrait of George IV</title2>
		<creator>Phillips, Thomas</creator>
		<description>Engraved vignette portrait of George IV, King of Great Britain (1762-1830) with geometrical surround design. George IV, both as Prince Regent and King, bestowed a number of favours upon Sir Walter Scott. In 1813 he offered Scott the post of Poet Laureate (which Scott refused in favour of Robert Southey). In 1815 he twice invited Scott to dine with him and granted him free access to the Regent's Library, where Scott consulted papers on the Jacobite Rebellions of 1715 and 1745-46. In 1818 Scott became the first man to be knighted under George IV and the first ever to be knighted in recognition of literary merit. When the new king commissioned Sir Thomas Lawrence to paint the most distinguished men of the age for the great gallery at Windsor Castle, he desired that Scott be foremost amongst the men of science and letters. For his part, Scott played a leading role in organizing the visit of King George IV to Edinburgh in 1822, the first visit of a Hanoverian monarch to Scotland. The 'Magnum Opus' edition of the Waverley Novels is dedicated to the King. The uncredited engraving is based on a painting by Thomas Phillips and closely resembles an engraving by Luigi Schiavonetti in the National Portrait Gallery.</description>

		<description>Engraved portrait of the English historian Edward Gibbon (1737-1794). Edward Gibbon, best known for his History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire (1776-88), was a constant source and model for Sir Walter Scott, particularly in Count Robert of Paris (1831), which drew extensively on Gibbon's account of the Byzantine Empire under the Komnenian Restoration. The Introduction to the novel quotes extensively from Gibbon's judgment of the princess and historian Anna Komnene or Comnena. The original portrait by Sir Joshua Reynolds was painted ca. 1779. The engraving by Holl is based on an earlier engraving by John (not James) Hall published in 1780.</description>

		<title1>Goethe: From a Picture by George Dawe. Esqr. RA in the Possession of Henry Dawe Esq</title1>
		<title2>Steel engraved portrait of Goethe by J. Posselwhite after a painting by George Dawe</title2>
		<creator>Dawe, George</creator>
		<description>Engraved portrait of the German author Johann Wolfgang von Goethe (1749-1832). Sir Walter Scott began his literary career with a series of translations from contemporary German literature. Of Goethe, the European writer whom Scott most admired, he translated Goetz of Berlichingen (1799), 'The Erl-King' (1799), 'Frederick and Alice' (1800), and 'Lamentation of the Faithful Wife of Asan Aga' (1806). Scott described Goethe as 'a wonderful fellow, the Ariosto at once, and almost the Voltaire of Germany' (Journal, 15 February 1827) and acclaimed him as 'an author born to arouse the slumbering fame of his country' (Introduction to 'Magnum' edition of Anne of Geierstein, 1831). Scott was bitterly disappointed that Goethe's death on 22 March 1832 thwarted a long-cherished plan to visit him at Weimar. Goethe, in his turn, was a great admirer of the Waverley Novels, praising Scott in a letter of 12 January 1827 for his 'wonderful pictures of human life'. Deeply flattered, Scott sent Goethe a copy of his Life of Napoleon Buonaparte and hailed him as 'the father of the German literature' (letter of 9 July 1827). The original portrait by George Dawe was painted in 1819.</description>

		<title1>Rev. James Grahame, Author of "The Sabbath." andC</title1>
		<title2>Steel engraved portrait of Rev. James Grahame by S. Freeman</title2>
		<creator>Unknown</creator>
		<description>Engraved portrait of the Scottish poet the Rev. James Grahame (1765-1811). Sir Walter Scott was a great admirer of James Grahame's The Sabbath (1804), 'a very pretty poem' which he recommended to James Currie and Anna Seward in letters of 25 February and 21 March 1805. John Ballantyne and Co., in which Scott held a half-share, published his British Georgics (1809). Grahame was a fellow Advocate who abandoned the Bar to take orders as an Anglican clergyman. Scott sought unsuccessfully to use his influence to have Grahame elected to the Lectureship of St George's Chapel, Edinburgh, in October 1808. On his death in 1811, Scott lamented him as 'one good man lost to the best of possible worlds' who 'had conscience and modesty enough for a whole General Assembly or Convocation' (letter to Charles Kirkpatrick Sharpe, 4 December 1811). He regretted however that his 'principles and prejudices and feelings made an odd jumble', hampering both his legal and ecclesiastical careers. He was a Jacobite yet a Whig, an Anglican yet an apologist for the Covenanters. Scott recalled teasing him for his detestation of his own kinsman John Graham of Claverhouse. Grahame is also mentioned in Letters on Demonology and Witchcraft as sharing the family superstition that the colour green is fatal to the Grahame clan, and having his library table covered in blue or black cloth.</description>

		<creator>Miereveld, Michiel Jansz van (b.1567, d.1641)</creator>
		<description>Engraved portrait of the Dutch jurist and scholar Hugo Grotius (1583-1645). In chapter 1 of A Legend of Montrose (1819), Sir Walter Scott quotes Grotius's condemnation of mercenaries: 'Nullum vitae genus est improbius, quam eorum, qui sine causae respectu mercede conducti, militant' ('There is no more immoral way of life than that of these men who, regardless of the cause, fight for money'). Equally, when in Old Mortality (1816), James Graham of Claverhouse laments the Covenanters' contempt for the 'laws of war', he is referring to Grotius's De jure belli ac pacis libri (1625). In a letter to his son Captain Walter Scott of 25 December 1827, Scott hopes that his younger son Charles is busy studying 'Grotius, Puffendorf and others of that class of jurists' in order to obtain a post at the Foreign Office. The original portrait by Miereveld was painted in 1614.</description>

		<creator>Dyck, Anthony van (b.1599, d.1641)</creator>
		<description>Engraved portrait of Gustavus Adolphus, King of Sweden (1594-1632). Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden achieved renown as a military commander during the Thirty Years War (1618-48) with the aid of a brigade of Scottish mercenaries. In Sir Walter Scott's A Legend of Montrose (1819), the soldier of fortune Captain Dalgetty refers constantly to his service under 'that invincible monarch, the bulwark of the Protestant faith, the Lion of the North, the terror of Austria, Gustavus the Victorious' (ch. 2). Captain Dalgetty's horse Gustavus is named in honour of his former commander. In Old Mortality (1816), Henry Morton considers taking up arms abroad: 'Perhaps some lucky chance may raise me to a rank with our Ruthvens, our Lesleys, our Monroes, the chosen leaders of the famous Protestant champion, Gustavus Adolphus' (ch. 6). Gustavus Adolphus's Scottish brigade is also discussed in Tales of a Grandfather, Second Series (1829).</description>

		<creator>Wright, John Michael</creator>
		<description>Engraved portrait of the English jurist Sir Matthew Hale (1609-1676). In Letter VIII of Letters on Demonology and Witchcraft (1830), Sir Walter Scott regrets to quote 'the venerable and devout Sir Matthew Hales [sic]', as presiding at a trial in 1644 which saw two women Amy Dunny and Rose Callender hanged as witches on the flimsiest evidence. 'But no man', adds Scott, 'unless very peculiarly circumstanced, can extricate himself from the prejudices of his nation and age.' Scott had previously published the final recommendations of the Hale Committee (1652) on law reform in the Somers Tracts, vol. VI (1811). He quoted from this document in his own 'Essay on Juridical Reform' (1810). The original portrait was painted ca. 1670.</description>

		<title1>Hampden: From a Print by J. Houbraken 1740</title1>
		<title2>Steel engraved portrait of John Hampden by J. Posselwhite after a print by J. Houbraken</title2>
		<creator>Houbraken, Jacobus</creator>
		<description>Engraved portrait of the English parliamentarian John Hampden (1594-1643). Hampden was staunchly opposed to autocratic rule of Charles I, particularly the King's attempts to levy the 'ship money' tax. There are several references to Hampden in Scott's novels of 17th-century England and Scotland. In Old Mortality (1816), the putative narrator Peter Pattieson writes that many Covenanters 'united the independent sentiments of a Hampden with the suffering zeal of a Hooper or Latimer' (ch. 1). In Woodstock (1826), the hostility of the wolfhound Bevis to the fugitive Charles II leads the King to believe that 'the spirit of Pym or Hampden has transmigrated into the rogue and continues to demonstrate his hatred against royalty and all its adherents' (ch. 24). In an Appendix to the Introduction to the 'Magnum Opus' edition of Peveril of the Peak (1831), Scott writes that 'the adventures ascribed to "historical characters" would, however, fail in their moral aim, if fiction were placed at variance with truth; if Hampden or Sydney, for example, were painted as swindlers'. Finally, a note to the 'Magnum' edition of Ivanhoe (1830) reveals that Scott borrowed his hero's name 'from a manor forfeited by the ancestor of the celebrated Hampden, for striking the Black Prince a blow with his racket, when they quarrelled at tennis'.</description>

		<title1>Handel: From a Picture in the Collection of His Majesty at Windsor</title1>
		<title2>Steel engraved portrait of Handel by J. Thomson after a painting by T. Hudson</title2>
		<creator>Hudson, Thomas</creator>
		<description>Engraved portrait of the German-British composer Georg Friedrich Handel (1685-1759). Sir Walter Scott was, by his own admission, no connoisseur of music. When his wife Charlotte attended the Edinburgh Music Festival in 1815, the highlight of which was a performance of Handel's Messiah, Scott preferred to stay at Abbotsford. He wrote that he was 'delighted with your having found the gaieties of the time acceptable' but that he would not 'give one "wheeble of a whaup" from the moss at Keaside for all the fine music you have heard' (letter of 11 November 1805). Scott nonetheless named Handel as pre-eminent in the art of music in his Life of Dryden (1808), where Handel's setting of Dryden's 'Alexander's Feast' is discussed. Handel is also quoted as identifying the morris dance as the quintessential English dance in a note to the Magnum Opus edition of The Fair Maid of Perth (1832). This engraving is based on a 1756 portrait of Handel by Thomas Hudson, now in the National Portrait Gallery.</description>

		<title1>Walter Scott, 1777, AEtat. 6</title1>
		<title2>Engraved portrait of Sir Walter Scott as a child by J. Horsburgh from a copy of the original miniature</title2>
		<creator>Daniel, Abraham</creator>
		<description>Profile portrait of Sir Walter Scott at the age of four or five. The original 'Bath miniature' was painted by an anonymous artist during the young Scott's visit to Bath in 1775/76. Although the dates for this visit are uncertain, it is likely that Lockhart's dating (1777) is wrong, and that Scott was at most five years old at the time of the sitting. The miniature has been attributed to Abraham Daniel of Bath (d. 1806) by Sir John Pope-Hennessy (Francis Russell, Portraits of Sir Walter Scott, p. 36). The engraving is made from a copy of the miniature at Abbotsford which Lockhart erroneously believed to be the original. The original is held by the Society of Antiquaries.</description>

		<creator>Allan, William</creator>
		<description>Portrait of Sir Walter Scott, aged around fifty-six, sitting at his desk in his study at Abbotsford. The original portrait by William Allan was painted from sketches of Sir Walter Scott's study at Abbotsford, possibly made when Allan was working on his oil sketch A F̻te Champ̻tre at Abbotsford in August 1827. The editor of The Anniversary notes that some minor changes to the arrangement took place after these sketches were taken. Francis Russell suggests that the painting may have been made specifically in order to be engraved (Portraits of Sir Walter Scott, p. 25).</description>

		<description>Head and shoulders portrait, facing right, of Sir Walter Scott at the age of thirty-six. Scott sat for the original portrait by Sir Henry Raeburn in spring 1808. Commissioned by Archibald Constable, it was completed in the same year. It is now in the possession of the Duke of Buccleuch and Queensberry at Bowhill. This engraving was originally published in The Mirror of Literature, 1826. The engraver was probably John Roffe (1769-1850). It is likely, however, that part of Roffe's work has been confused with that of an identically named engraver, possibly a son, active between 1820 and 1861. Roffe's engraving is itself based on an 1810 mezzotint by Charles Turner and an 1821 engraving by J. R. West.</description>

		<creator>Raeburn, Henry, Sir (b.1756, d.1823)</creator>
		<description>Three-quarter length portrait of Sir Walter Scott at the age of thirty-six. In his Portraits of Sir Walter Scott (1987), Frances Russell treats this engraving as a derivation of the portrait painted by Raeburn for Archibald Constable in spring 1808 (p. 74). In unpublished research James C. Corson argues that it was more probably derived from a second portrait by Raeburn, painted in 1809. and now on display at Abbotsford. The portrait was copied by J. G. Lockhart. The initials P.M. on the plate stand for Peter Morris, the pseudonym that Lockhart adopted when writing Peter's Letters to His Kinsfolk (1819), the publication for which this engraving was made. The engraver was William Home Lizars, son of Daniel Lizars. Although Daniel Lizars died in 1812, the family occasionally continued to use W. and D. Lizars as a collective signature.</description>

		<description>Depicts a bridge over the River Tweed at Ashestiel, near Selkirk, Scottish Borders. Ashestiel was Sir Walter Scott's summer residence from 1804 to 1811. It was here that Marmion and the first abortive chapters of Waverley were written. When the Ashestiel lease expired in May 1811 the Scott family moved to the site which was to become Abbotsford.</description>

		<creator>Home, Gordon</creator>
		<description>Presents a view of the River Tweed, the Tweed Valley, and the Eildon Hills from Bemersyde Hill near Melrose, Scottish Borders. According to popular tradition, Sir Walter Scott so favoured this view and paused there so frequently on his way home to Abbotsford, that his horses eventually learned to stop without command. They are reputed to have stopped at the viewpoint even when drawing Scott's funeral carriage en route for Dryburgh Abbey in 1832.</description>

		<description>Presents a view of Bemersyde House, near Melrose, Scottish Borders, and its gardens. The view from Bemersyde Hill, near Melrose, which overlooks the Tweed Valley and Eildon Hills, was a particular favourite of Scott's. Directly under the brow of the hill lies Bemersyde House, seat of the Haigs of Bemersyde, where Scott was a frequent visitor. The house incorporates a rectangular tower built around 1535 which was restored and greatly extended in the 18th century.</description>

		<description>Presents a view of Branxholme Castle, near Hawick, Scottish Borders, with the River Teviot in the foreground. Branxholme Castle is the ancient seat of the Dukes of Buccleuch, and provides the setting for much of The Lay of the Last Minstrel. Alternative spellings include Branxholm and Branksome, the latter preferred by Scott. The Lay of the Last Minstrel portrays the efforts of the Lady of Branksome to prevent marriage between her daughter and a feudal enemy and the siege of Branksome at the hands of an English army.</description>

		<title2>Engraved picture of Cadzow Forest by W. Forrest after H. McCulloch</title2>
		<creator>McCulloch, Horatio</creator>
		<description>Depicts Cadzow Forest, near Hamilton, Lanarkshire, with white cattle grazing. In the Introduction to Sir Walter Scott's ballad Cadyow Castle, he describes Cadyow (or Cadzow) Forest: 'In the immediate vicinity of Cadyow is a grove of immense oaks, the remains of the Caledonian Forest... they have witnessed the rites of the Druids... There was long preserved in this forest the breed of the Scottish wild cattle... Their appearance was beautiful, being milk-white, with black muzzles, horns, and hoofs.' Cadzow Forest was a favourite subject of Horatio McCulloch who depicted it in a number of paintings between 1834 and 1865. It is unknown which formed the basis for this engraving.</description>

		<description>Depicts the ruins of Caerlaverock Castle, Dumfriesshire. Ellangowan Castle, seat of the Bertrams in Sir Walter Scott's Guy Mannering (1815), is often thought to be based on Caerlaverock Castle which Scott visited with Guthrie Wright in 1806. The engraver may be John Landseer who signed the frontispieces to The Beauties of Scotland (presumably working from his own design).</description>

		<creator>Hill, David Octavius</creator>
		<description>An image of Dobbs Linn, near Moffat, Dumfriesshire, depicting a ravine with a waterfall cascading into a pool. A young girl, Katharine Laidlaw, is indicating the entrance to a hidden cave. Dobbs Linn was used as hiding-place by the Covenanters during the 'Killing Times'. The Linn and its surroundings influenced the geography of Sir Walter Scott's Tale of Old Mortality. ('Linn' can mean either a cascade, the pool into which a cascade falls, or a ravine.) The original painting by David Octavius Hill was made expressly for the 1837 edition of Tales and Sketches by the Ettrick Shepherd [i.e. James Hogg]. It illustrated a scene from 'The Brownie of Bodsbeck' where Katharine, daughter of the hero Walter Laidlaw, leads him to a hidden cave in the Linn.</description>

Sir Walter Scott included the ballad of Thomas the Rhymer in the second volume of his Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border (1802), adding a 'Third Part' of his own composition. Scott also believed Thomas to be the author of 'Sir Tristrem', which he edited for publication in 1804.</description>

In The Heart of Mid-Lothian (1818), ch. 3, a group of people including Bartoline Saddletree and Reuben Butler discuss the reprieve of Captain Porteous while returning to their houses in the Lawnmarket via 'the steep declivity of the West Bow'. The West Bow was originally a steep winding road leading from the Grassmarket (site of the gallows) to Castle Hill, offering the only means of access to Edinburgh Castle from the South. It was largely demolished in the 1830s when Victoria Street and George IV Bridge were built to provide more convenient access. Only a small portion of the West Bow now survives at the foot of Victoria Street.</description>

		<description>Depicts the ruins of Fast Castle near St Abbs Head, Berwickshire. Fast Castle has been identified as an inspiration for Wolf's Crag, the home of the Master of Ravenswood in Sir Walter Scott's The Bride of Lammermoor (1819). In the Magnum Opus edition of the novel (1830), Scott claims that he cannot comment on the perceived resemblance between Wolf's Crag and Fast Castle as he has only seen the latter from the sea. He acknowledges, however, that the position of Fast Castle resembles that of Wolf's Crag as much as any other fortalice on the East Coast of Scotland. Scott also describes the castle in Provincial Antiquities and Picturesque Scenery of Scotland (1826). Scott owned a painting of Fast Castle by the Rev. John Thomson (Letters, VIII, 459).</description>

		<description>Depicts a view of Floors Castle, Kelso, Scottish Borders, and grounds. Scott was a frequent visitor to Floors (formerly Fleurs) Castle which was built by William Adam for the 1st Duke of Roxburghe in 1721. In his unfinished Autobiography (1808) Sir Walter Scott describes the awakening of a sense of beauty during childhood stays in Kelso, 'the most beautiful, if not the most romantic, village in Scotland'. Among its sights, he lists the castle 'which is so situated as to combine the ideas of ancient baronial grandeur with those of modern taste'. He again praises the beauty of Floors Castle in Letters on Demonology and Witchcraft (1830).</description>

Linlithgow Palace was built in the eleventh century and was a royal residence from the twelfth to the late sixteenth century. It was accidentally gutted by fire in 1746. In Marmion (1808), Sir Walter Scott describes Linlithgow as: 'Of all the palaces so fair, | Built for the royal dwelling, | In Scotland, far beyond compare | Linlithgow is excelling;' (canto IV, stanza XV, lines 1-4). The Palace is more fully described in Scott's Provincial Antiquities and Picturesque Scenery of Scotland (1826) and features in a number of his other works, notably Waverley (1814) and Tales of a Grandfather (1828-1830). The entrance porch at Scott's home of Abbotsford was modelled after that of Linlithgow Palace.</description>

Loch Ard is described in chapter 20 of Scott's Rob Roy (1817): 'But the road now suddenly emerged from the forest ground, and, winding close by the margin of the loch, afforded us a full view of its spacious mirror, which now, the breeze having totally subsided, reflected in still magnificence the high dark heathy mountains, huge grey rocks, and shaggy banks, by which it is encircled.' The Falls of Ledard at the head of the Loch are thought to be the model for the waterfall in the Glen of Glennaquoich in Waverley, ch. 22. Scott recommended the Loch and the Falls as artistic subjects to Sir David Wilkie and James Skene (Letters, IV, 484, and IX, 224).</description>

		<description>Depicts Kilchurn Castle on the shores of Loch Awe (Argyll and Bute). Loch Awe and its surrounding countryside feature in a number of Sir Walter Scott's works. 'The Highland Widow' (1827) is set on its banks. In 'Nora's Vow', translated from the Gaelic for Albyn's Anthology (published by Alexander Campbell in 1816), the heroine protests that she will never marry the Earl's son even if 'The Awe's fierce stream may backward turn, | Ben-Cruaichan fall, and crush Kilchurn' (III.3-4). Loch Awe also appears in A Legend of Montrose, ch. 17. In a letter to the painter Sir David Wilkie, dated 2 August 1817), Scott recommends that he 'visit the head of Loch Awe, which I look upon as equal to any thing in the Highlands' (Letters, IV, 484).</description>

In 'Nora's Vow', translated from the Gaelic for Albyn's Anthology (published by Alexander Campbell in 1816), the heroine protests that she will never marry the Earl's son even if 'The Awe's fierce stream may backward turn, | Ben-Cruaichan fall, and crush Kilchurn' (III.3-4). Loch Awe also appears in A Legend of Montrose, ch. 17. In a letter to the painter Sir David Wilkie, dated 2 August 1817), Scott recommends that he 'visit the head of Loch Awe, which I look upon as equal to any thing in the Highlands' (Letters, IV, 484).</description>

		<creator>Roberts, David</creator>
		<description>Depicts people among the ruins of Melrose Abbey, Scottish Borders. Sir Walter Scott coordinated the restoration of Melrose Abbey in 1822. The Abbey features in many of Scott's works, most famously The Lay of the Last Minstrel (1805): 'If thou would'st view fair Melrose aright, | Go visit it by the pale moonlight [...] | Then view St. David's ruin'd pile; | And, home returning, soothly swear, | Was never scene so sad and fair!' (canto II, stanza I, lines 1-2, 16-18). The religious house of Kennaquhair in The Monastery and The Abbot (both 1820) is based on the Abbey, and it is described in detail in Scott's 'Essay on Border Antiquities' (1814). The original work by David Roberts (1796-1864) was completed after 1822 and prior to 1859.</description>

		<description>Depicts Magdalen and Roland Graeme visiting Melrose Abbey, Scottish Borders, after it has been sacked by the Reformers (The Abbot, ch. 8). Kennaquhair Abbey in Scott's novels The Monastery and The Abbot (both 1820) is generally thought to be based on Melrose Abbey. This engraving illustrates a scene from chapter 13 of The Abbot: 'Magdalen and Roland remained alone in that great vaulted space... and in the pell-mell havoc, the tombs of warriors and of princes had been included in the demolition of the idolatrous shrines. Lances and swords of antique size, which had hung over the tombs of mighty warriors of former days, lay now strewed among relics.' The engraving was first published in the first edition of Leitch Ritchie's Scott and Scotland (1835).</description>

Neidpath, near Peebles, is a 14th-century castle converted into a 17th-century tower house. At the turn of the 19th century, it was home to Scott's close friend Adam Ferguson. Neidpath Castle has also been suggested as the model for Saint Ronan's Castle as described in chapter I of Saint Ronan's Well (1823).</description>

		<description>Depicts Newark Castle, Scottish Borders, and surrounding countryside. In Sir Walter Scott's The Lay of the Last Minstrel (1805), the minstrel receives hospitality from the Duchess of Buccleuch at Newark Castle and, in return, recites a tale about her ancestors. SScott accompanied William Wordsworth on a visit to the ruined 15th-century castle in September 1831 which inspired Wordsworth's poem 'Yarrow Revisited'.</description>

		<description>Depicts the River Tweed with Norham Castle, Northumberland, in the background. Sir Walter Scott's Marmion (1808) begins with the arrival of Lord Marmion at Norham Castle: 'Day set on Norham's castled steep, | And Tweed's fair river, broad and deep, | And Cheviot's mountains lone: | The battled towers, the donjon keep, | The loophole grates, where captives weep, | The flanking walls that round it sweep, | In yellow lustre shone' (canto I, stanza I, lines 1-7) . Lord Marmion spends the night at Norham then proceeds on a mission to the Scottish Court.</description>

		<title2>Engraving of Peebles and Neidpath Castle by W. Miller after P. Paton</title2>
		<creator>Paton, Peter</creator>
		<description>Depicts a view of the River Tweed from the top of Neidpath Castle, Scottish Borders. Sir Walter Scott's poem 'The Maid of Neidpath' was published in William Whyte's A Collection of Scottish Airs (1806-07): 'Disease had been in Mary's bower | And slow decay from mourning, | Though now she sits on Neidpath's tower | To watch her Love's returning' (lines 5-8). Neidpath, near Peebles, is a 14th-century castle converted into a 17th-century tower house. At the turn of the 19th century, it was home to Scott's close friend Adam Ferguson. Neidpath Castle has also been suggested as the model for Saint Ronan's Castle as described in chapter I of Saint Ronan's Well (1823).</description>

The chapel, a 15th-century building located 9 miles south of Edinburgh, is also described in Scott's Provincial Antiquities and Picturesque Scenery of Scotland (1826) and is thought to have provided the model for the convent of Engaddi in The Talisman (1825). Its architecture inspired the rich moulded ceiling of the library at Scott's home of Abbotsford.</description>

In his unfinished Autobiography (1808), Scott lists the 'distant vestiges of Roxburgh Castle' among the sights which make Kelso 'the most beautiful, if not the most romantic village in Scotland'. Roxburgh Castle is a ruined 11th-century royal residence which repeatedly changed hands during the Wars of Independence. Scott relates the tale of its daring capture by Sir James Douglas (the 'Black Douglas') in 1313 in Tales of a Grandfather, First Series (1828). There are further brief mentions of the castle in The Monastery (1820) and The Talisman (1825). The entrance hall at Abbotsford boasts two cannonballs supposed to have been used in the siege of Roxburgh Castle in 1460.</description>

On 16 December 1799 Sir Walter Scott was appointed Sheriff Depute of Selkirkshire, a post which he held until his death in 1832. The post required Scott to reside in the county for part of the year, in order to perform his duties at Selkirk Sheriff Court. Initially Scott stayed at Clovenfords Inn, near Galashiels, but eventually in 1804 leased the property of Ashestiel. Selkirk is often thought to be the model for Middlemass, the Border town portrayed in the opening chapters of 'The Surgeon's Daughter' (1827).</description>

		<description>Depicts the basalt columns of Fingal's Cave, Staffa, Inner Hebrides. Walter Scott visited Fingal's Cave in 1810: 'It exceeded in my mind every description I had heard of it [...] the appearance of the cavern composed entirely of basaltic pillars as high as the roof of a cathedral and running deep into the rock, eternally swept by a deep and swelling sea, and paved as it were with ruddy marble baffles all description' (Letter to Joanna Baillie, July 19, 1810). He subsequently described the cave in The Lord of the Isles (1815), canto IV, stanza X: 'that wondrous dome, | Where, as to shame the temples deck'd | By skill of earthly architect, | Nature herself, it seem'd, would raise | A Minster to her Maker's praise!'

The concluding scenes of Sir Walter Scott's The Lady of the Lake (1810) take place in 'the bulwark of the North, | Grey Stirling, with her towers and town' (canto V, stanza XVIII, lines 34-35). The castle features in a number of Scott's works, most notably Waverley, ch. 38, where the Jacobite party guarding Edward Waverley exchange fire with the castle's garrison. The stained glass portraits of Scottish kings in the armoury window at Scott's home of Abbotsford are based on carvings in the presence chamber of Stirling Castle.</description>

Traquair House, near Peebles, parts of which date from the twelfth century, is considered to be the oldest continually inhabited house in Scotland. It was one of Walter Scott's favourite haunts and has been suggested as a model for the castles of Tully-Veolan in Waverley (1814) and Ellieslaw in The Black Dwarf (1816).</description>

		<creator>Home, Gordon</creator>
		<description>Depicts the closed Bear Gates of Traquair House, Scottish Borders. Traquair House, near Peebles, parts of which date from the twelfth century, is considered to be the oldest continually inhabited house in Scotland. It was one of Walter Scott's favourite haunts and has been suggested as a model for the castles of Tully-Veolan in Waverley (1814) and Ellieslaw in The Black Dwarf (1816). In particular, the recurring bear motif at Tully-Veolan is thought to have been suggested by the Bear Gates of Traquair. According to tradition, the Bear Gates have been closed ever since the 5th Earl of Traquair bid farewell to Prince Charles Edward Stuart and swore that the gates would not re-open until the Stuart monarchy was restored.</description>

		<title2>Engraving of Turnberry Castle by J. Stewart after P. Gibson</title2>
		<creator>Gibson, Patrick</creator>
		<description>Depicts Turnberry Castle, Ayrshire, with Ailsa Craig in the background. Edith, the heroine of Walter Scott's The Lord of the Isles (1815), is captured by the English at Turnberry Castle, the ancestral home and birthplace of Robert the Bruce. The Bruce lays siege to the castle, rescues Edith, and goes on to regain most of Scotland. Scott had never visited Turnberry Castle so, while working on The Lord of the Isles in 1814, requested and obtained local information from his friend the Gallowegian antiquarian Joseph Train. The castle was demolished by the Bruce himself in 1310 to prevent it from falling into English hands. It was never rebuilt.</description>

The Yarrow Valley (or Yarrowdale) was one of the favourite haunts of Walter Scott and fertile ground for gathering songs for his Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border (1802-03). The district is particularly celebrated in The Lay of the Last Minstrel (1805), where the aging minstrel sings: 'By Yarrow's stream still let me stray, | Though none should guide my feeble way' (canto VI, stanza II, lines 14-15).</description>

		<creator>Pourbus, Frans the younger</creator>
		<description>Engraved portrait of Henri IV, King of France (1553-1610). In ch. 22 of Sir Walter Scott's novel Woodstock (1826), the heroine Alice Lee hopes that the exiled Charles II will unite all the kingly virtues of his grandfather Henri IV of France: his 'chivalrous courage', 'warlike skill', 'all his benevolence, love of his people, patience even of unpleasing advice, sacrifice of his own wishes and pleasures to the commonweal'. While in Paris in 1815, Walter Scott spent time in the King's Library reading letters of Henri IV to his mistress Gabrielle d'Estr̩es. The original portrait by Frans Pourbus the Younger was painted between 1605 and 1610.</description>

John Cam Hobhouse, Lord Broughton, was one of Lord Byron's closest friends. Such was his loyalty to the poet that he came to be known as 'Byron's bulldog'. Hobhouse corresponded with Scott in 1826 and 1828 concerning a monument to Byron to which Scott subscribed.

		<description>Engraved self-portrait of English artist William Hogarth (1697-1764) with pug dog. Walter Scott owned a Hogarth self-portrait (not that engraved here) which he displayed in the dining room at Abbotsford. Scott consistently cited Hogarth as the supreme artist. In chapter 1 of The Bride of Lammermoor (1819), the artist Dick Tinto wonders why he should shun the name of 'an out-of-doors artist' when Hogarth himself 'has introduced himself in that character in one of his best engravings'. The engraving by James Mollison was made from a self-portrait painted in 1745.</description>

		<description>Sketch of English author Theodore Hook (1788-1841), with facsimile of signature. Walter Scott expressed admiration for Theodore Hook's 'Sayings and Doings' and offered support during Hook's imprisonment as a state debtor. It was largely through Scott's offices that Hook was appointed editor of the Tory newspaper John Bull in 1820. However, Scott also warned J. G.

		<description>Portrait of English politician and economist Francis Horner (1778-1817). Francis Horner was one of the founders of the Edinburgh Review, to which Scott contributed reviews between 1803 and 1806 before withdrawing for political reasons. Scott found Horner's writings solemn and humourless: 'I will not admire your Horner: he always puts me in mind of Obadiah's bull, who, although, as Father Shandy observed, he never produced a calf, went through his business with such a grave demeanour, that he always maintained his credit in the parish!' (quoted in J. G. Lockhart, Memoirs of the Life of Sir Walter Scott, Bart.). Horner was also a founding member with Scott of the influential literary and social 'Friday Club' in 1803. The original portrait by Henry Raeburn was painted in 1812.</description>

		<description>Engraved portrait of the Scottish philosopher, David Hume (1711-1776). Scott's concept of history owes much to that developed by David Hume. Scott jokingly suggested publishing a complete poetic works of David Hume with illustrations and explanatory texts - there is only one short doggerel poem, scratched in the glass at an inn at Carlisle, which is accredited to Hume (letter to J.B.S. Morritt, 2 October 1815). This portrait was engraved by William Holl the Elder from an earlier engraving by Anker Smith published in 1806. The original portrait by Allan Ramsay was painted in 1766.</description>

		<description>Black and white facsimile of a portrait of David Hume (1757-1838) as Baron of the Exchequer. Walter Scott enjoyed the University lectures of his Scots Law professor, David Hume (nephew and heir to the philosopher of the same name). In his unfinished 'Autobiography' (1808), Scott praised Hume's 'penetration and clearness of conception' and hailed him as an 'architect' to the law of Scotland. In 1811, Scott and Hume were rival candidates for the post of Principal Clerk to the Court of Session. Hume was offered the post and irritated Scott by vacillating for some time before accepting. Nonetheless, Hume remained a valued friend and colleague and was one of the first to guess the identity of the 'Author of Waverley'. The original portrait by Raeburn was commissioned by the Society of Writers to Her Majesty's Signet in 1822. It remains part of the Society's collection.</description>

		<creator>Maclise, Daniel</creator>
		<description>Sketch of English author Leigh Hunt (1784-1859), with facsimile of signature. Scott wrote 'Mr. Leigh Hunt I only know from his writings but these show so much more cleverness than judgement' and considered his Lord Byron and Some of His Contemporaries to be 'injudicious and open to much censure' (letter to Horatio Smith, 1 February 1828). Scott felt that 'having eaten Byrons [sic] salt while he lived Mr Hunt should have spared his memory when he was departed'. In letters of 5 February and 4 March to J. G. Lockhart, he urged his son-in-law to treat the volume severely when reviewing it for the Quarterly Review. Hunt had already offended Scott by satirizing him in his The Feast of the Poets (1815). Writing in his Autobiography (1850), Hunt regretted the offence, wishing that political differences had not prevented him from seeing that Scott was a 'man of a kindly nature'.

Walter Scott was an ardent admirer of Washington Irving and his work, particularly Knickerbocker's History of New York.

		<creator>Lockhart, John Gibson</creator>
		<description>Engraved portrait of the Scottish lawyer and critic Francis Jeffrey (1773-1850). Francis Jeffrey was one of the founders of the Edinburgh Review and responsible for asking his fellow advocate Walter Scott to contribute. The Review flourished with Jeffrey as editor, and he became a powerful and influential critic. Jeffrey reviewed a number of Scott's own works making few concessions to personal friendship. Scott was particularly hurt by his critique of Marmion (1808), feeling that it might have been couched 'in language rather more civil to a personal friend'. While entertaining the highest regard for Jeffrey's talents, Scott felt he lacked 'the taste for poetry which is essentially necessary to enjoy and of course to criticize it with justice', and specifically 'that enthusiastic feeling which like sun-shine upon a landscape lights up every beauty and palliates if it cannot hide ever defect' (letter to Joanna Baillie, 31 October 1808). The signatures P.M. and W. Wastle refer to Peter Morris and William Wastle, both aliases adopted by Lockhart in his Peter's Letters to His Kinfolk (1819). Lockhart, then, appears to have engraved the print after his own design.</description>

		<description>Sketch of Scottish journalist William Jerdan (1782-1869), with facsimile of signature. A native of Kelso, William Jerdan was the founder and editor of the Literary Gazette. His father John Jerdan was an early acquaintance of Scott and a schoolfriend of his father and uncle. In his Autobiography (London: A. Hall, Virtue, 1852-1853), Jerdan regrets having offended Scott by his strictures on some of his works. However, in the later years of Scott's life, Jerdan adds, he was 'on most friendly terms' with Scott and 'among the foremost of his acquaintances' when he visited London (vol. IV, pp. 344-45). Jerdan also included a biographical sketch of Scott in his Men I Have Known (1866). Scott's correspondence reveals irritation at Jerdan's habit of inserting premature or erroneous announcements of new publications by Scott.

		<description>Engraved portrait of English author Samuel Johnson (1709-1784). Sir Walter Scott was intimately acquainted with and frequently quoted from the works of Samuel Johnson. He particularly admired Johnson's satirical poems London and The Vanity of Human Wishes. In 1823, Scott edited Johnson's Rasselas for Ballantyne's Novelists Library, and provided a biographical sketch of the author which was subsequently reprinted as one of his Lives of the Novelists. In 1829, Scott supplied J.W. Croker with numerous anecdotes concerning Johnson for his edition of Boswell's Life of Johnson. The original portrait by Joshua Reynolds was painted in 1772. The engraving by William Holl the Elder was first published in 1814.</description>

		<description>Engraved portrait of English poet and playwright, Ben Jonson (1573?-1637). Walter Scott drew liberally on Ben Jonson's comedies when depicting 17th-century London life in his novel The Fortunes of Nigel (1822). Scott considered Jonson 'one of our our neglected classics' and urged the Rev. Edward Forster to prepare a 'handsome and complete' edition of his dramas (letter of 27 October 1805). Scott frequently quoted from Jonson in his published works and correspondence, particularly favouring Every Man in His Humour. The original portrait by Abraham van Blyenberch was painted ca. 1617.</description>

		<creator>Unknown</creator>
		<description>Engraved portrait of an unidentified 17th-century Scottish divine, once thought to be John Knox (ca. 1514-1572). Scott never portrayed John Knox directly in his fiction, but his 1820 novels The Monastery and The Abbot portray the triumph of the Knox-inspired Reformation in Scotland. Scott's preacher Henry Warden is presented as second only in power and eloquence to Knox. In The Abbot even the Catholic Mary Queen of Scots salutes Knox's power, describing him as 'the ablest and most powerful of heresiarchs' (ch. 25). Scott also described Knox's role in the Reformation in the historical Tales of a Grandfather, First Series (1828), where Knox is introduced as 'a man of great corage, zeal, and talents' and as the 'bold and inflexible father of the Scottish Reformation'. For each of these works, Knox's own Historie of the Reformation of the Church of Scotland was an important source. The Somerville portrait, whose authenticity was asserted by Thomas Carlyle, is no longer thought to be an image of Knox.</description>

		<description>Sketch of English essayist Charles Lamb (1775-1834) at his desk, with facsimile of signature. Walter Scott met the essayist Charles Lamb in the London studio of the painter Benjamin Robert Haydon in March 1821. Scott later contributed to Charles Lamb's fundraising efforts for William Godwin, and issued an invitation for Lamb to visit should he ever be in Scotland, 'though I have not forgotten his metropolitan preference of houses to rocks, and citizens to wild rustics and highland men' (Letter to Benjamin Robert Haydon, October 1822). Lamb replied on 29 October 1822, saying that he would be delighted to take up Scott's offer in the unlikely event of his ever visiting Scotland.

		<description>Engraved portrait of the Anglo-American painter Charles Robert Leslie (1794-1859). In September 1824, Leslie visited Abbotsford to paint a portrait of Scott which had been commissioned by the American academic Prof. George Ticknor. Leslie was also a prolific illustrator of Scott's works, contributing to The Novels and Tales of the Author of Waverley (1823), the 'Magnum Opus' edition of the Waverley Novels (1829-32), Charles Heath's Waverley Album (1832) and Portraits of the Principle Female Characters in the Waverley Novels (1833-34). In his General Preface to the 'Magnum Opus' edition of the Waverley Novels, Scott thanks Leslie for his efforts as an illustrator as 'a friend as well as an author'. While at Abbotsford he also painted Scott's factotum Tam Purdie.</description>

		<title2>Engraved portrait of Rob Roy by W. Worthington after an original drawing</title2>
		<creator>Worthington, William Henry</creator>
		<description>Engraved portrait of Rob Roy MacGregor (1671-1734). The 18th-century Scottish freebooter and folk hero Rob Roy MacGregor is one of the principal characters (but not the protagonist) of Sir Walter Scott's 1817 novel Rob Roy. The 1829 'Magnum Opus' of the novel came complete with a historical introduction to the lives of Rob Roy and his sons, supplemented by letters and other documentation. Scott began collecting anecdotes of Rob Roy when his apprenticeship in his father's legal firm (1786-87) brought him into contact with Highland clients and eventually led to his first trips to the Highlands. One client, in particular, Alexander Stewart of Invernahyle had once fought a duel with Rob Roy. The portrait is engraved by William Henry Worthington from 'an original drawing' quite possibly by Worthington himself.</description>

		<description>Engraved portrait of Scottish novelist Henry Mackenzie (1745-1831). Scott read Henry Mackenzie's novels in his youth and became his friend and colleague in adulthood. Mackenzie contributed to Walter Scott's Edinburgh Annual Register and both men were trustees of the Edinburgh Theatre. In 1823, Scott edited Mackenzie's fiction for Ballantyne's Novelists Library, and provided a biographical sketch of the author which was subsequently reprinted as one of his Lives of the Novelists. This portrait was engraved by William Home Lizars, son of Daniel Lizars. Although Daniel Lizars died in 1812, the family occasionally continued to use WandD Lizars as their signature.

		<description>Engraved half-length portrait of Robert Macqueen, Lord Braxfield (1722-1799) in his judicial robes. When the young Sir Walter Scott's family moved to George Square, Edinburgh, in 1774, one of their neighbours was Robert Macqueen, Lord Braxfield, Lord Justice Clerk and a judge of notorious severity. When studying for the Bar, Scott politically dedicated his thesis to Braxfield, a move which paid off when Braxfield found the young advocate work at the circuit court at Jedburgh. This portrait was engraved by William Home Lizars, son of Daniel Lizars. Although Daniel Lizars died in 1812, the family occasionally continued to use WandD Lizars as their signature.</description>

		<creator>Unknown</creator>
		<description>Engraved portrait of Mary, Queen of Scots (1542-1587) in a black velvet robe. The plot of Sir Walter Scott's The Abbot (1820) revolves around the imprisonment and escape from Loch Leven Castle, Fife, of Mary, Queen of Scots. Scott also treats her reign at length in his historical works Tales of a Grandfather, First Series (1828) and The History of Scotland (1830). The following quote from Walter Scott's The Abbot (Chapter 21) is below the engraved portrait: "Her dress was a robe of black velvet, a small ruff open in front, gave a full view of her beautifully formed chin and neck. On her head she wore a small cap of lace, and a transparent white veil hung from her shoulders over the long black robe in, large loose folds." The engraving by George B. Shaw is based on an earlier engraving by James Thomson which appeared in Edmund Lodge's Portraits of Illustrious Personages of Great Britain. The original painting by an unknown artist is known as the Morton or Dalmahoy Portrait.</description>

		<title2>Engraved portrait of Henry Dundas, Lord Melville by an unknown artist probably after J. Reynolds</title2>
		<creator>Reynolds, Joshua, Sir (b.1723, d.1792)</creator>
		<description>Engraved oval portrait of British statesman Henry Dundas, Lord Melville (1742-1811). Henry Dundas, Lord Melville was a close friend and colleague of William Pitt the Younger, serving as Treasurer of the Navy, Secretary of War and later first Lord of the Admiralty. He also controlled Crown patronage in Scotland and was often described as ipso facto ruler of Scotland. His support was thus essential when Scott applied for and obtained the posts of Sheriff-Depute of Selkirkshire (1799) and Principal Clerk to the Court of Session (1806). Lord and Lady Melville also became close friends of the Scotts. They had been Scott's childhood neighbours in George Square, Edinburgh, and Melville Castle was situated close to Scott's summer home of Lasswade. When Lord Melville was impeached for financial mismanagement in 1804, Scott composed two songs in celebration of his acquittal which were sung by James Ballantyne at a public dinner in Melville's honour. The original portrait from which this engraving was taken is probably that painted by Sir Joshua Reynolds in 1782.</description>

		<description>Engraved oval portrait of English poet John Milton (1608-1674). Walter Scott was familiar with the works of Milton from early childhood. Alison Cockburn, a distant relative of Scott's mother, recorded her astonishment at the six-year-old Scott's precocity. When she asked his opinion of Milton, Scott expressed puzzlement that the newly-created Adam should know everything. She satisfied him with the reply that he was created perfect by God (quoted in J. G. Lockhart's Memoir of the Life of Sir Walter Scott, Bart.). Later, in the Introduction to Canto I of Marmion (1808), Scott cited Milton among the 'mightiest chiefs of British song' who did not disdain chivalrous or romantic legends: 'They gleam through Spenser's elfin dream, | And mix in Milton's heavenly theme' (lines 273-74).</description>

		<description>Engraved portrait of French playwright Moli̬re (1622-1673). Scott was a great admirer of the French playwright Moli̬re, from whose comedies he frequently quoted in both his published work and correspondence. In an article on Moli̬re for the Foreign Quarterly Review in 1828, Scott saluted him as 'a complete master of comedy [...] the property, not of that country alone which was honoured with his birth, but of the civilized world'. In 1829, Scott sent his son Charles an edition of Moli̬re's complete works, 'confident I cannot contribute more to your amusement' (letter of 17 November 1829).</description>

		<description>Engraved portrait of Scottish poet and hymnist James Montgomery (1771-1854) seated at his desk In 1824 James Montgomery asked Walter Scott to contribute a poem for a propaganda work entitled The Chimney-Sweeper's Friend. Scott declined, but a portion of his response was published in the Preface. Here Scott expressed his support for Montgomery's cause, and wrote that he had had the chimneys at Abbotsford made circular and smooth so that they could be cleaned by a 'simple machine', rather than a child (letter to James Montgomery, January 4, 1824). Montgomery, who published a critical account of Marmion in The Critical Review (1808) considered Scott 'an admirable writer' except when he dealt with modern subjects: 'in his magic circle he is inimitable - out of it, a gentleman who writes with ease' (quoted in Helen C. Knight's Life of James Montgomery (1857), p. 133). He was, however, an unconditional admirer of Lockhart's biography of Scott, finding Scott's life 'more intensely attractive to my mind, and in itself even more marvellous, than any of his fictions' (ibid., p. 316). The original painting by T. H. Illidge was made in 1841 and this engraving first appeared in an edition of Robert Chambers's Lives of Illustrious and Distinguished Scotsmen.</description>

He secured his collaboration in the Quarterly Review and published some of his verse in his English Minstrelsy (1810). In 1809 Walter Scott wrote an anonymous poetic imitation of Moore for the Edinburgh Annual Register.

He was chief advisor to Regent Murray, becoming Regent after his death, and defeated Mary's forces at Langside after her escape from Lochleven Castle. In The Abbot he is portrayed as 'deep and dark' (ch. 3), the implacable and ruthless enemy of Mary and the Catholic cause.

		<description>Engraved portrait of William Pitt the Younger (1759-1806) during his second term as Prime Minister. Walter Scott mourned the recently deceased Pitt the Younger in Marmion (1808): 'The mind that thought for Britain's weal,... | While faith and civil peace are dear, | Grace this cold marble with a tear,--- | He, who preserved them, Pitt, lies here!' (Introduction to Canto First, lines 61, 123-125). Pitt, for his part, was a great admirer of The Lay of the Last Minstrel (1805) and told Scott's childhood friend William Dundas that 'it would give him pleasure to advance the fortunes of such a writer'. When Scott was told of Pitt's admiration, he wrote that 'I can say without affectation that I would rather have the satisfaction of having been approved by him, though now dead, than by all the living statesmen and nobility in Europe' (letter to Lady Abercorn, 20 September 1806). The original portrait by John Hoppner was painted in 1804/05.</description>

		<description>Engraved portrait of English poet and satirist, Alexander Pope (1688-1744). In his unfinished Autobiography (1808), Scott recalls that, as a child of five or six, his 'hours of leisure were usually spent in reading aloud to my mother Pope's translation of Homer, which, excepting a few traditionary ballads, and the songs in Allan Ramsay's Evergreen, was the first poetry which I perused'. According to Lockhart, Scott called Pope a 'true deacon of the craft' and long cherished a plan to publish a complete edition and biography of Pope as he had done for Swift. The original portrait, made c. 1739-84, is by William Hoare rather than Thomas Hudson.</description>

		<description>Engraved portrait of Walter Scott's forester, Tom Purdie (d. 1829), sitting on a rock with a gun in his lap. Tom (or Tam) Purdie was first employed by Scott in 1804 as a shepherd but rose to become his forester, gamekeeper, all-round factotum, and faithful companion. In a Journal entry for 7 January 1826, Scott wrote: 'What a blessing is a man like Tom whom no familiarity can spoil, whom you may scold and praise and joke with, knowing the quality of the man is unalterable in his love and reverence for his master'. Scott was greatly shocked by his sudden death on 29 October 1829, feeling that he had 'lost feet and hands so ready was [Purdie] always to supply the want of either' (letter to Mary Ann Hughes, 1 December 1829). The original portrait by Edwin Landseer was probably made during the artist's stay at Abbotsford in October 1824.</description>

		<description>Engraved self-portrait of Scottish artist, Sir Henry Raeburn (1756-1823). Raeburn, the most celebrated Scottish portraitist of his day, painted four likenesses of Sir Walter Scott: for Archibald Constable in 1808, for Scott himself in 1809, for Lord Montagu, and for Raeburn's own private gallery (both 1823). Scott disliked the first two portraits, lamenting that Raeburn had 'twice made a very chowderheaded [i.e. clumsy- or thick-headed] person of me' (letter to Duke of Buccleuch and Queensberry, 15 April 1819). On Raeburn's death, Scott wrote that 'painting is deprived of a votary of genius, our city of an ornament, and society of a most excellent and most innocent member' (letter to Benjamin Robert Haydon, 8 July 1823). The original self-portrait by Henry Raeburn was painted in 1815.</description>

In his unfinished Autobiography (1808), Scott quotes from an elegy by Robert on the imagined loss of his ship written on the eve of Rodney's victory in the Battle of the Saintes (April 9-12, 1782). In a footnote to the Magnum Opus edition of The Pirate (1831), Scott reveals that Captain Cleveland's tales of the haunted isles of the Caribbean (ch. 22) derive from stories told by his brother. The original portrait by Sir Joshua Reynolds was painted in 1789.</description>

		<creator>Maclise, Daniel</creator>
		<description>Facsimile of a sketch of English poet Samuel Rogers (1763-1855), seated in an armchair, with facsimile of signature. Sir Walter Scott met Rogers when visiting London in 1803. He frequently breakfasted with Rogers in subsequent visits to London and corresponded with him. Rogers supported and wrote for the Quarterly Review (the journal that Scott set up to rival the Whig Edinburgh Review) and contributed a lyric to Scott's English Minstrelsy (1810). In a letter to J. G. Lockhart, Scott describes Rogers as 'a man of honour and humanity when out of his poetical character in which he harbours a little too much irritability' (30 May 1826). This facsimile reproduction is of one of a series of portraits originally published in Fraser's Magazine, 1830-1838, under the title 'A Gallery of Illustrious Literary Characters'.</description>

		<description>Engraved profile portrait of Scottish mathematician and physicist Sir John Leslie (1766-1832) at a podium. In 1808 Sir Walter Scott engaged Leslie, Professor of Mathematics at Edinburgh University, to contribute scientific articles to the Edinburgh Annual Register. Writing to George Ellis, Scott described Leslie as 'a great philosopher, and as abominable an animal as I ever saw', adding that 'he writes, however, with great eloquence, and is an enthusiast in mathematical, chemical, and mineralogical pursuits' (13 December 1808). The original artist is J. G. Lockhart using the pseudonym W. Wastle, a character in his Peter's Letters to his Kinfolk. Lockhart may also be the engraver.</description>

		<title1>Schiller: From a Print by Faustin Anderloni, after a Picture by G. von Kugelgen</title1>
		<title2>Engraved portrait of Friedrich Schiller by J. Posselwhite after F. Anderloni after G. von Kugelgen</title2>
		<creator>K�_gelgen, Gerhard von</creator>
		<description>Engraved profile portrait of German author Friedrich Schiller (1759-1805). Beginning in 1792, Walter Scott enthusiastically read the works of Goethe and Schiller with a group of friends at Edinburgh University. Inspired by Alexander Fraser Tytler's translation of Schiller's drama Die Ruber, Scott prepared his own version of Schiller's Die Verschw̦rung des Fiesco zu Genoa. The manuscript is now lost but Scott recalled that he 'used to read it to sobbing and weeping audiences and no wonder, for whatever may be thought of the translation the original is sublime' (letter to Mary Anne Hughes, 13 December 1821). Scott also wrote a play The House of Aspen in imitation of Schiller, which he later dismissed as 'a sort of half-mad German tragedy which I wrote many years ago when my taste was very green and when like the rest of the world I was taken in with the bombast of Schiller' (letter to Lady Abercorn, 17 May 1811). Although he distanced himself from his early love of German theatre, it is widely thought to have exerted a profound influence on his conception of the historical novel. The original portrait by Gerhard von Kugelgen was probably painted in 1808 or 1809. Posselwhite's engraving is derived from an earlier engraving by Faustino Anderloni.</description>

		<creator>Taylor, John</creator>
		<description>Engraved portrait of English playwright William Shakespeare (1564-1616). Scott steeped himself in Shakespeare's plays from his earliest youth, and his works abound in allusions to and quotations from them. Shakespeare appears as a character in chapter 17 of Kenilworth (perhaps, with Rokeby, Scott's most Shakespearian work) and is warmly praised by Queen Elizabeth I. A bust of Shakespeare occupies pride of place in Scott's library at Abbotsford. A long-cherished project to publish a popular edition of Shakespeare never came to fruition. The original portrait of William Shakespeare is attributed to John Taylor and is dated c. 1610.</description>

		<description>Portrait of Scottish artist, poet, and antiquarian Charles Kirkpatrick Sharpe (1781-1851), seated at a table. Sharpe was a close friend of Sir Walter Scott. He contributed both traditional ballads and original verse to Scott's Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border (1802-1803), and collaborated on the Annual Register and Quarterly Review. Scott proposed Sharpe for the position of King's Limner after the death of Sir Henry Raeburn in 1823, but it had already been given to David Wilkie. The lithograph by W.H. MacFarlane was taken from a photograph by David Octavius Hill, executed between 1843 and 1851.</description>

		<description>Engraved portrait of Welsh actress Sarah Siddons (1755-1831) as the Tragic Muse. Sarah Siddons (n̩e Kemble) was considered the finest tragedian and interpreter of Shakespeare of her age. Offstage, Scott found her 'a vain foolish woman spoild [sic] (and no wonder) by unbounded adulation to a degree that deserved praise tasted faint on her palate'. He doubted, however, that he would ever see another actress who came 'within a hundred degrees of what she was in her zenith' (letter to Joanna Baillie, 17 April 1819). He appealed to Mrs Siddons for support of the new patent for the Edinburgh Theatre that would put its management under the control of the Duke of Buccleuch, Walter Scott himself and Henry Mackenzie, among others. Her son Henry Siddons was subsequently appointed manager. The original portrait by Sir Joshua Reynolds was painted in 1784. The engraving by William Holl the Younger was first published in Knight's Portrait Gallery (1835).</description>

In 1812, the brothers James and Horace Smith published Rejected Addresses, or, The New Theatrum Poetarum, a collection of parodies of contemporary poets. Walter Scott was one of the collection's many admirers, declaring 'I have seldom been so much diverted with any thing this long while' (letter to Sarah Smith, 11 December 1812).

		<description>Engraved half-length portrait of John Somers, Lord Chancellor of England (1651-1716). Between 1809 and 1815, Sir Walter Scott prepared a revised edition of A Collection of Scarce and Valuable Tracts: On the Most Interesting and Entertaining Subjects: But Chiefly Such as Relate to the History and Constitution of these Kingdoms. Generally known as the Somers Tracts, this collection of historical pamphlets was largely drawn from the library of John Somers, Lord Chancellor of England, 1697-1700. Scott had found the original edition (published 1748-1751) particularly helpful when preparing his edition of the works of Dryden (1808). The original portrait of Baron Somers by Sir Godfrey Kneller was painted ca. 1715-1716.</description>

		<description>Engraved portrait of English poet Robert Southey (1774-1843), with decorative border. Scott and Southey first met when Southey visited him at Ashestiel in August 1805. Later in the same month, Scott visited Southey at Keswick, and subsequently made further visits in 1813 and 1825. Southey contributed to a number of Scott's literary projects, including An Apology for Tales of Terror (1799), his English Minstrelsy (1810), the Quarterly Review, and the Edinburgh Annual Register. Scott made repeated attempts to secure a salary for the impecunious Southey. Finally when Scott was offered the position of Poet Laureate in 1813, he declined and instead recommended Southey. The original drawing of Robert Southey by Henry Edridge was made in 1804.</description>

		<description>Engraved portrait of a man commonly identified as English poet Edmund Spenser (ca. 1552-1599). As Scott recorded in his unfinished Autobiography (1808), Edmund Spenser's The Fairie Queene was a childhood favourite. There are frequent allusions to and quotations from Spenser's allegory in Scott's fiction, and it provided a model for his poems The Vision of Don Roderick (1811) and The Bridal of Triermain (1813).</description>

		<description>Engraved half-length portrait of French-Swiss author Madame de Stalcl (1766-1817). When Madame de Stalcl was rumoured to be planning a visit to Edinburgh in 1814, Scott wrote that he would be 'both curious and pleased' to see a woman of her 'literary reputation' (letter to Sarah Smith, 8 January). Should, however, the visit be cancelled, he would not altogether regret it 'for as I tired of some of her works, I am afraid I should disgrace my taste by tiring of the authoress too' (letter to Joanna Baillie, 10 December 1813). Scott drew on Madame de Stalcl's Memoirs when preparing his Life of Napoleon Bonaparte (1827-1828). The original portrait by Fran̤ois G̩rard was painted in 1818.</description>

		<description>Engraved portrait of Italian poet Torquato Tasso (1544-1595) crowned with laurels. As described in his unfinished Autobiography (1808), Sir Walter Scott first discovered Tasso's Gerusalemme Liberata while at school in Kelso (1783). At Edinburgh University (1786-1790), Scott took evening lessons in Italian in order to read Tasso, Ariosto, and other poets in the original. Edward Waverley, hero of Scott's first novel, shares his creator's love of Italian Romance. Hart's engraving is based on an earlier engraving by Raphael Morghen, which was taken from the original portrait by Pietro Ermini (op. 1799-1820).</description>

		<creator>Beechey, William</creator>
		<description>Engraved seated portrait of Scottish engineer James Watt (1736-1819). In the preface to The Monastery, Scott saluted Watt as 'the man whose genius discovered the means of multiplying our national resources to a degree perhaps even beyond his own stupendous powers of calculation and combination; bringing the treasures of the abyss to the summit of the earth--giving the feeble arm of man the momentum of an Afrite--commanding manufactures to arise, as the rod of the prophet produced water in the desert--affording the means of dispensing with that time and tide which wait for no man, and of sailing without that wind which defied the commands and threats of Xerxes himself'. He was, furthermore, 'one of the best and kindest of human beings'. Scott presided at a meeting, at the Waterloo Hotel, Edinburgh, to raise subscriptions for a monument to Watt on 9 July 1824. The original portrait of Watt by Sir William Beechey was painted in 1801.</description>

		<creator>Lawrence, Thomas</creator>
		<description>Engraved sketch portrait of the Duke of Wellington (1769-1852), with facsimile of signature. Sir Walter Scott was a great admirer of Wellington's generalship in the Peninsular War. In 1811 he declared Wellington 'the only man we had to trust to' (letter to John B.S. Morritt, 26 April). He was 'a man of genius and talent, not deterd [sic] by obstacles, not fettered by prejudices, not immured within the pedantries of his profession but playing the general and the heroe [sic] where most of our military commanders would have exhibited the drill Serjeant or at best the adjutant'. Scott celebrated Wellington's victories in The Vision of Don Roderick (1811) and The Field of Waterloo (1815). Scott met Wellington in Paris in 1815 and gave an account of their interview in Paul's Letters to His Kinsfolk, where the account of the Battle of Waterloo draws largely on Wellington's own account. Later, Wellington supplied notes on Napoleon's Russian campaign for Scott Life of Napoleon Bonaparte (1827-1828). Adlard's engraving is derived from an earlier print by Frederick Christian Lewis (1779-1856). The original drawing by Sir Thomas Lawrence was made c. 1820.</description>

		<description>Engraved portrait of John Wilson (1785-1854), Scottish poet, essayist, and Professor of Moral Philosophy at Edinburgh University. Along with Scott's son-in-law and biographer J. G. Lockhart and James Hogg, John Wilson was the principal contributor to the satirical Blackwood's Magazine. Scott considered him 'very clever but somewhat whimsical' (letter to Mrs Clephane, 3 December 1818) and thought him a doubtful influence on J.G. Lockhart as he disputed 'with low adversaries' and indulged in biting, personal attacks (letter to Lady Louisa Stuart, 13 April 1826). Scott successfully canvassed for Wilson in his campaign to be elected Professor of Moral Philosophy at Edinburgh University (1820). Scott hoped that the position would give Wilson 'the consistence and steadiness which is all he wants to make him the first man of the age' (letter to J.G. Lockhart, 30 March 1820). The original portrait by Robert Scott Lauder was exhibited in 1832. The engraving was probably made before 1850 when John Horsburgh scaled down his professional activities.</description>

		<creator>Maclise, Daniel</creator>
		<description>Facsimile of sketch of English poet William Wordsworth (1770-1850), with facsimile of signature. Sir Walter Scott was a friend and admirer of Wordsworth. They first met when Scott accompanied the poet and his sister on a tour of the Border Country in September 1803. Scott visited the Wordsworths at Grasmere in August 1805 and climbed Helvellyn with Wordsworth and Sir Humphry Davey. A further visit to Grasmere took place in August 1825. Finally, the Wordsworths visited Abbotsford in 1831, leading Wordsworth to compose 'On the Departure of Sir Walter Scott from Abbotsford, for Naples'. Writing of Wordsworth, Scott declared that he did not know 'a man more to be venerated for uprightness of heart and loftiness of genius' (letter to Allan Cunningham, 7 January 1821). His conversation 'as much distinguished by manly sense and candour as by talent and principle, was like a fountain in the desert' (letter to Sir George Beaumont, 28 August 1825). Scott, who particularly admired Wordsworth's sonnets, regretted that his poetry was not as popular as it deserved to be as it was 'too subtle and metaphysical in the idea, and too blunt in the expression' (letter to Allan Cunningham, 14 October 1828).

		<title2>Engraving of Abbotsford House by T. Barber after T.H. Shepherd</title2>
		<creator>Shepherd, Thomas Hosmer</creator>
		<description>Depicts a view of the front of Abbotsford House, Scottish Borders. When Scott bought the 110-acre Cartley Hole Farm in 1811 he renamed it Abbotsford. He bought up neighbouring properties until in 1825 the estate had expanded to ten times its original size. By 1821, the residence that he had built between 1812 and 1818 had become too small for the estate and for the constant stream of visitors that he received. A two-storey manor house (portrayed here) was built in its stead. Scott continued to live in Abbotsford following the financial disaster of 1825-26 as the estate had been settled upon his newly married son Walter. Abbotsford proved immensely influential on nineteenth-century building styles, sparking the Victorian revival of Scots-Baronial architecture. The architects were William Atkinson and Edward Blore, with assistance from Scott himself.</description>

By 1821, the residence that he had built between 1812 and 1818 had become too small for the estate and for the constant stream of visitors that he received. A two-storey manor house (portrayed here) was built in its stead. Scott continued to live in Abbotsford following the financial disaster of 1825-26 as the estate had been settled upon his newly married son Walter. Abbotsford proved immensely influential on nineteenth-century building styles, sparking the Victorian revival of Scots-Baronial architecture. The architects were William Atkinson and Edward Blore, with assistance from Scott himself.</description>

		<description>Depicts a view of Loch Lomond from Dumbarton, with Ben Lomond in the background. Ben Lomond and Loch Lomond form a dramatic part of the scenery in a number of Sir Walter Scott's works, including Rob Roy (1817) and The Lady of the Lake (1810), where Roderick Dhu is portrayed as 'the terror of Loch Lomond's side' (canto II, stanza XI, line 14). Scott visited the Loch with his wife in the summers of 1809, 1816, and 1817.</description>

		<creator>Unknown</creator>
		<description>Depicts the opposing armies of the Government and the Covenanters clashing on Bothwell Bridge, South Lanarkshire. The Battle of Bothwell Bridge (22 June 1679) saw a government army under James, Duke of Monmouth, decisively defeat an army of Covenanters and effectively put an end to their rebellion. It is dramatized in ch. 31-32 of Scott's Old Mortality (1816). Scott also included the traditional 'Ballad of Bothwell Brig' in his Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border (1802-1803), adding extensive historical notes, and gave a further account of the battle in the Second Series of his Tales of a Grandfather (1828).</description>

In ch. 37 of Scott's Old Mortality (1816), Henry Morton passes the 'romantic ruins of Bothwell Castle' as he revisits the scene of the Covenanters' defeat at the Battle of Bothwell Bridge (1679). Scott had first visited the castle, a 13th-century edifice located southeast of Glasgow, in 1799 when visiting Lord and Lady Douglas. He was inspired to write the unfinished ballad 'Bothwell Castle'. On a later visit he wrote the ballad of 'Young Lochinvar' which he published as part of Marmion (1808).</description>

		<creator>Drummond, Samuel</creator>
		<description>Engraved portrait of British statesman John Wilson Croker (1780-1857) in a fur-collared coat. Croker was a close friend and political ally of Sir Walter Scott. In 1813 Scott wrote to Croker to suggest Robert Southey for the post of Poet Laureate (a post that Scott himself had declined). In 1818 Croker also assisted Scott in obtaining a warrant to search for the Regalia (Crown Jewels) of Scotland. In 1824 Croker persuaded Scott to join with Thomas Moore and others to found the Athenaeum Club. Their relations were momentarily strained in 1826 when Croker penned a caustic reply to Scott's Letters of Malachi Malagrowther. Scott would subsequently assist Croker with his new edition of Boswell's Life of Johnson (1831). Another work by Croker, Stories for Children from the History of England (1817), provided the model for Scott's Tales of a Grandfather (1828-1831). The original portrait by Samuel Drummond was probably commissioned by the European Magazine in 1812.</description>

		<description>Engraved portrait of British scientist Sir Humphry Davy (1778-1829), with facsimile of signature. Sir Walter Scott and Davy were fellow guests of William Wordsworth's at Dove Cottage, Grasemere, in August 1805. Scott 'liked him excessively' and was 'particularly delighted with the total absence of pedantry which has always appeared to me the test of true genius' (letter to Jane Kerr Apreece, 2 April 1811). Davy later made two visits to Scott at Abbotsford in 1820 and 1823. In 1812 Davy had become a member of Scott's extended family by marrying his widowed cousin Jane Kerr Apreece. As a favour to her Scott wrote a review of Davy's Salmoniana for the Quarterly Review in 1828.</description>

		<description>Depicts, from left to right, the Sceptre of James V, the Scottish Crown, and the Sword of State, which together constitute the Regalia of Scotland. Following the Act of Union between England and Scotland in 1707, the ancient Regalia (or 'Honours') of Scotland were deposited in a locked oak chest in the Crown Room of Edinburgh Castle. Over the following decades, their whereabouts was forgotten, and it was rumoured that, counter to the terms of the Union, they had been carried away to England. Prompted by Sir Walter Scott, the Prince Regent set up a commission to search the Crown Room for the Regalia. On 4 February 1818, the Commissioners, including Scott, discovered the chest and found, wrapped in linen, the fourteenth-century Scottish Crown, the Sceptre of James V, and the Sword of State, a gift from Pope Julius II to James V. The Regalia were subsequently placed on permanent display in the Crown Room. Scott described the discovery in his Description of the Regalia of Scotland (1819). Andrew Geddes was asked to paint the Regalia for the frontispiece to the 9th Part of the Provincial Antiquities in 1824. The oil painting on which the engraving is based is held at Abbotsford.</description>

		<description>Depicts a crowd of people in Greyfriars Churchyard, Edinburgh, gathered to sign the National Covenant, with Edinburgh Castle in the background. In Tales of a Grandfather, Second Series (1829), Sir Walter Scott describes the mass signing of the National Covenant in Greyfriars Kirkyard, Edinburgh, which began on 28 February 1638. The Covenant challenged the Divine Right of Kings, demanding a free Scottish Parliament, a free General Assembly of the Church of Scotland, the abolition of bishops, and establishment of Presbyterian church government. The ensuing 'Covenanting' wars feature in a number of Scott's works, most notably Old Mortality (1816). Greyfriars Kirkyard also had personal associations for Scott. His and sister were both buried there in the Scott family burial-plot. According to J. G. Lockhart, Scott also made the acquaintance of his first love Williamina Belsches in the Kirkyard.</description>

		<title1>Moray House, Canongate</title1>
		<title2>Lithograph of Moray House, Edinburgh by T. Picken after J. Nash</title2>
		<creator>Nash, Joseph</creator>
		<description>Depicts a fierce battle outside Moray House on Canongate, Edinburgh. In Sir Walter Scott's Chronicles of the Canongate (1827), Mrs Bethune Baliol recalls her mother's account of watching the last riding of the Scottish Parliament in 1707 from 'the balcony in front of Lord Moray's Lodging in the Canongate'. Moray House was built in the 1620s by Mary, Dowager Countess of Home. It served as Cromwell's Edinburgh lodgings in 1648 and 1650-1651, and was the scene of some of the negotiations which led to the Treaty of Union in 1707. The building is now part of Edinburgh University's Moray House School of Education.</description>

		<title2>Lithograph of the National Monument, Calton Hill, Edinburgh by T. Picken after J.D. Harding</title2>
		<creator>Harding, James Duffield</creator>
		<description>Depicts the National Monument on Calton Hill, Edinburgh. The National Monument was built between 1824 and 1829 in memory of those who had died in the Napoleonic Wars. It was modelled on the Parthenon in Athens, but only the fa̤ade was completed. It is generally believed that funding ran out, but surviving drawings by the architects C. R. Cockerell and William Playfair suggest that no building had been projected beyond the extant structure. Scott wrote approvingly of Playfair's plans in a letter to Robert Johnston, 19 September 1819. Scott described Calton Hill in Provincial Antiquities and Picturesque Scenery of Scotland (1826), but made no reference to the National Monument.</description>

		<description>Depicts a group of soldiers marching down West Bow, Edinburgh. In The Heart of Mid-Lothian (1818), ch. 3, a group of people including Bartoline Saddletree and Reuben Butler discuss the reprieve of Captain Porteous while returning to their houses in the Lawnmarket via 'the steep declivity of the West Bow'. The West Bow was originally a steep winding road leading from the Grassmarket (site of the gallows) to Castle Hill, offering the only means of access to Edinburgh Castle from the South. It was largely demolished in the 1830s when Victoria Street and George IV Bridge were built to provide more convenient access. Only a small portion of the West Bow now survives at the foot of Victoria Street.</description>

		<title1>Eildon Hills</title1>
		<title2>Hand-coloured aquatint of a view of Eildon Hills by J. Merigot after J. Girten.</title2>
		<creator>Girtin, Thomas</creator>
		<description>Depicts the River Tweed with the Eildon Hills (Scottish Borders) in the background. In The Lay of the Last Minstrel (1805), Sir Walter Scott alludes to the legend that the peak of Eildon Hill was split into three by the wizard Michael Scott. The Monk of Melrose Abbey recalls meeting the wizard and tells Sir William of Deloraine: 'And, Warrior, I could say to thee | The words that cleft Eildon hills in three, | And bridled the Tweed with a curb of stone: | But to speak them were a deadly sin | And for having but thought them my heart within | A treble penance must be done' (canto II, stanza 13, lines 8-13). Scott's first aborted attempt to write a prose romance Thomas the Rhymer revolved around the legend that a cavern existed beneath the Eildon Hills, where King Arthur and his knights lay sleeping (see the General Introduction to the Waverley Novels (1829)). The Hills are mentioned in numerous other works by Scott, notably 'The Eve of St John' (1799). The prospect of the Eildon Hills from Bemersyde was a favourite of Scott's and is now known as 'Scott's view'.</description>

		<description>Depicts the entrance to Falkland Palace, Fife. In Sir Walter Scott's 'Fair Maid of Perth', the heroine Catharine Glover is tricked into taking refuge in Falkland Castle to escape the attentions of the Duke of Rothsay, the heir to the Scottish throne. A further stratagem brings the Duke to the Castle where he is murdered by his dismissed Master of the Horse, Sir John Ramorny. Scott's Journal for 27 June 1829 records a visit to the 'most interesting remains' of Falkland Palace. There are further references to the building throughout Scott's works, notably in Marmion (1808) and Tales of a Grandfather (1828-31).</description>

The Abbey features in many of Scott's works, most famously The Lay of the Last Minstrel (1805): 'If thou would'st view fair Melrose aright, | Go visit it by the pale moonlight [...] | Then view St. David's ruin'd pile; | And, home returning, soothly swear, | Was never scene so sad and fair!' (canto II, stanza I, lines 1-2, 16-18). The religious house of Kennaquhair in The Monastery and The Abbot (both 1820) is also based on the Abbey, and is described in detail in Scott's 'Essay on Border Antiquities' (1814).</description>

		<title2>Lithograph of Fast Castle by T. Picken after H. Bright</title2>

		<description>Depicts Fast Castle near St Abbs Head, Berwickshire. Fast Castle has been identified as an inspiration for Wolf's Crag, the home of the Master of Ravenswood in Sir Walter Scott's The Bride of Lammermoor (1819). In the Magnum Opus edition of the novel (1830), Scott claims that he cannot comment on the perceived resemblance between Wolf's Crag and Fast Castle as he has only seen the latter from the sea. He acknowledges, however, that the position of Fast Castle resembles that of Wolf's Crag. Scott also describes the castle in Provincial Antiquities and Picturesque Scenery of Scotland (1826). Scott owned a painting of Fast Castle by the Rev. John Thomson (Letters, VIII, 459).</description>

		<description>Depicts Glamis Castle, Angus. Scott visited Glamis (or Glammis) Castle, seat of the Earl of Strathmore in 1793. In his Letters on Demonology and Witchcraft (1830), he recalls experiencing 'that degree of superstitious awe that my countrymen call eerie' when spending the night at the notoriously haunted castle. He wrote: 'I must own, that as I heard door after door shut, after my conductor had retired, I began to consider myself too far from the living and somewhat too near the dead' (Letter X). Glenallan House in Scott's novel, The Antiquary (1816), is said to be based on Glamis Castle.</description>

It is mentioned in ch. 29 of the novel as a sure place of refuge for Rob Roy Macgregor as it belongs to his wife's relatives. Glen Falloch has also been identified with the 'gloomy and desolate' spot, haunted by a spirit known as the 'Cloght-dearg', where the clergyman Mr Tyrie meets Elspat MacTavish Mhor in The Highland Widow (1827). The original drawing by G. F. Robson was probably taken expressly for Scotland Delineated.</description>

There are further references in The Black Dwarf and The Monastery. The Abbey was built by David I around 1138 but had fallen into ruin by the mid-sixteenth century. Scott was a frequent visitor to Jedburgh in his capacity as Sheriff Depute of Selkirkshire. He subscribed �10 toward the repair-work on the Abbey's tower in 1824-1826. The engraving by Richard Godfrey was probably made for Francis Grose's The Antiquarian Repertory (1775-1784). It is likely to have been made from Godfrey's own design.</description>

		<title2>Lithograph of Leith Pier by T. Picken after C. Stanfield</title2>
		<creator>Stanfield, Clarkson</creator>
		<description>Depicts Leith Pier, Edinburgh, with people gathered around a boat on the shore. According to his friend James Skene of Rubislaw, Scott frequently walked to Leith Pier, 'to which the freshness of the sea breeze offered a strong inducement to those accustomed to pass a few of the morning hours within the close and impure atmosphere of the Court of Session' (quoted in The Journal of Sir Walter Scott (Edinburgh: David Douglas, 1890), I, 210, n. 1). Scott gave a description and historical account of Leith harbour in Provincial Antiquities and Picturesque Scenery of Scotland (1826). Leith Pier features in Waverley (1814), ch. 56, where Edward Waverley obtains permission for his prisoner Colonel Talbot to sail from there to England, and in Old Mortality (1816), ch. 36, where Henry Morton sails into European exile from Leith. Scott himself sailed from Leith on 29 July 1814 when he accompanied the Commissioners for the Northern Lighthouse Service on a voyage of inspection.</description>

Linlithgow Palace was built in the eleventh century and was a royal residence from the twelfth to the late sixteenth century. It was accidentally gutted by fire in 1746. In Marmion (1808), Sir Walter Scott describes Linlithgow as: 'Of all the palaces so fair, | Built for the royal dwelling, | In Scotland, far beyond compare | Linlithgow is excelling;' (canto IV, stanza XV, lines 1-4). The Palace is more fully described in Scott's Provincial Antiquities and Picturesque Scenery of Scotland (1826) and features in a number of his other works, notably Waverley (1814) and Tales of a Grandfather (1828-30). The entrance porch at Scott's home of Abbotsford was modelled after that of Linlithgow Palace.</description>

		<description>Depicts the Cross in Market Square, Melrose, Scottish Borders. Sir Walter Scott's home of Abbotsford lay only a few miles west of the town of Melrose in the Scottish Borders. Melrose is set in the heart of the 'Scott Country', and is featured in many of his works, most notably The Lay of the Last Minstrel (1805) and, under the guise of 'Kennaquhair', in The Monastery and The Abbot (both 1820). Town and abbey are described in detail in Scott's 'Essay on Border Antiquities' (1814). At a vital moment in The Monastery, ch. 37, the Earl of Murray meets the Abbot of Kennaqhair beneath the 'mercat cross' in the town's marketplace to demand that he hand over Sir Piercie Shafton.</description>

		<description>Depicts Minto Tower (or Fatlips Castle), Scottish Borders. In The Lay of the Last Minstrel (1805), Sir William of Deloraine rides past the Minto Crags on his way to Melrose Abbey: 'On Minto-crags the moonbeams glint, | Where Barnhill hew'd his bed of flint; | Who flung his outlaw'd limbs to rest, | Where falcons hang their giddy nest, | Mid cliffs, from whence his eagle eye | For many a league his prey could spy; |Cliffs, doubling, on their echoes borne, | The terrors of the robber's horn' (canto I, stanza 27, lines 5-12). Minto Tower, more commonly known by the less poetical name of Fatlips Castle, is a 16th-century tower house, situated 4 miles west of Jedburgh. It was built by the Turnbulls of Barnhill, one of whom became a notorious Border freebooter. This view was probably drawn by Francis Grose in 1789 for his Antiquities of Scotland.</description>

Initially a Covenanter, Montrose was won over to the Royalist cause and waged a successful campaign against the Covenanters in the Highlands in 1644-1645. Sir Walter Scott's A Legend of Montrose (1819) is set against the backdrop of the 'Montrose wars'. Montrose's campaign, his subsequent betrayal by Charles II and execution by the Covenanters are also described in Scott's Tales of a Grandfather, Second Series (1829). Scott, a great admirer of Montrose, came into possession of his sword which he displayed in his 'armory' at Abbotsford. The original portrait by Gerrit van Honthorst was painted in 1649.</description>

Illustrates the following text: 'So saying, he [Cranbourne] took his sheathed rapier from his belt, and passing the point through the silk thread which secured the letter, he once more, and literally at sword point, gracefully tendered it to Major Bridgenorth who again waved it aside, though colouring deeply at the same time, as if he was putting a marked constraint upon himself' (Peveril of the Peak, ch. 9). The third figure in the engraving is the clergyman, Mr Solsgrace, who seeks to dissuade Major Bridgenorth from accepting the challenge. 'The Challenge', one of Orchardson's most celebrated paintings was completed in 1864.</description>

Ivanho̩ was first performed at the Od̩on, Paris, on 15 September 1826, with a libretto by Emile Deschamps and Gustave de Wailly. The music was selected from four Rossini operas, Semiramide, Mos̬, Tancredi, and La gazza ladra, and arranged by Antonio Pacini. Scott himself was in the audience for the 31 October performance and wrote in his Journal: 'It was superbly got up, the Norman soldiers wearing pointed helmets and what resembled much hauberks of mail, which looked very well. The number of the attendants, and the skill with which they were moved and grouped on the stage, were well worthy of notice. It was an opera, and of course the story greatly mangled, and the dialogue in a great part nonsense. Yet it was strange to hear anything like the words which I (then in an agony of pain with spasms in my stomach) dictated to William Laidlaw at Abbotsford, now recited in a foreign tongue, and for the amusement of a strange people.' Lacy's adaptation was first performed at Covent Garden on 7 March 1829.</description>

		<description>Depicts actor O. Smith (1786-1855) in the role of Christie of the Clinthill for the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane. Richard John Smith, better known as O. Smith, specialized in villainous parts. Here he is portrayed in the role of Christie of the Clinthill in The White Lady, or, La Dame Blanche, a comic opera combining motifs from Sir Walter Scott's Guy Mannering (1815) and The Monastery (1820). With music by Fran̤ois Adrien Boieldieu (1775-1834) and libretto by Eug̬ne Scribe (1791-1861), it was first performed at the Op̩ra comique, Paris, on 10 December 1825. The first British production took place at Drury Lane on 9 October 1826, with additional music by Thomas Cooke (1782-1848), and a libretto by Samuel Beazley (1786-1851),which deviated drastically from Scribe's original and which followed Scott more closely. The character of Christie of the Clinthill, absent from the Scribe version, was, in fact, introduced by Beazley from Scott's The Monastery.</description>

In Canto III of Sir Walter Scott's poem The Lord of the Isles (1815), Ronald, the Lord of the title, and his page Allan accompany Robert the Bruce to Skye. Scott had himself twice visited Skye, in July 1810 and again in the summer and autumn of 1814 when Scott joined a party of Commissioners for the Northern Lighthouse Service on a voyage of inspection around the coast of Scotland. In Waverley, ch. 22, Flora sings a Highland battle-song which calls on the 'proud chiefs of Clan Ranald, Glengarry, and Sleat' to 'combine like three streams from one mountain of snow, | And resistless in union rush down on the foe!'

Sir Walter Scott visited the Isle of Staffa in 1810 and declared it 'one of the most extraordinary places I ever beheld' which 'exceeded in my mind every description I had heard of it' (Letter to Joanna Baillie, July 19, 1810). He was particularly struck by Fingal's Cave: 'the appearance of the cavern composed entirely of basaltic pillars as high as the roof of a cathedral and running deep into the rock, eternally swept by a deep and swelling sea, and paved as it were with ruddy marble baffles all description'. He subsequently described Fingal's Cave in The Lord of the Isles (1815), canto IV, stanza X: 'that wondrous dome, | Where, as to shame the temples deck'd | By skill of earthly architect, | Nature herself, it seem'd, would raise | A Minster to her Maker's p raise!' (lines 13-17). The island and its caves are further celebrated in 'Lines Addressed to Ranald Macdonald, Esq. of Staffa' (1814).</description>

		<description>Depicts a regiment of soldiers patrolling the area around Stirling Castle. The concluding scenes of Sir Walter Scott's The Lady of the Lake (1810) take place in 'the bulwark of the North, | Grey Stirling, with her towers and town' (canto V, stanza XVIII, lines 34-35). The castle features in a number of Scott's works, most notably Waverley, ch. 38, where the Jacobites guarding Edward Waverley exchange fire with the castle's garrison. The stained glass portraits of Scottish kings in the armoury window at Scott's home of Abbotsford are based on carvings in the presence chamber of Stirling Castle.</description>

In Canto Fifth of Marmion (1808), James IV of Scotland sends Lord Marmion and Clara de Clare to Tantallon Castle: 'And, sudden, close before them showed | His towers Tantallon vast; | Broad, massive, high, and stretching far, | And held impregnable in war. | On a projecting rock they rose, | And round three sides the ocean flows' (stanza 23, lines 4-8). Tantallon Castle, built by the Earls of Douglas in the fourteenth century, is also described in Scott's Provincial Antiquities and Picturesque Scenery of Scotland (1826).</description>

		<description>Engraved half-length portrait of the Scottish historian Alexander Fraser Tytler, Lord Woodhouselee (1747-1813). Sir Walter Scott attended Alexander Fraser Tytler's courses in Universal History at Edinburgh University during the 1789-1790 session. Tytler's empiricism and his insistence on the determining influence of institutions, heredity, and environment had a profound impact on Scott's own vision of history. Scott was also greatly impressed by Tytler's translation of Schiller's Die Ra��uber (The Robbers) (1792) which inspired him to prepare his own translations of German drama and verse. Finally Tytler was sufficiently close a family friend to compose a Latin epitaph for Scott's dog Camp in 1809. The original portrait by Henry Raeburn was painted in 1804.</description>

In ch. 17 of Sir Walter Scott's The Abbot (1820), when Roland Graeme catches a first glimpse of Edinburgh, his companion Adam Woodcock points out Craigmillar Castle 'which I have known a merry place in my time'. The castle is also mentioned in Scott's account of Mary's reign in Tales of a Grandfather, First Series (1828). It is also described in detail in his Provincial Antiquities and Picturesque Scenery of Scotland (1826).</description>

		<title1>The Field of Prestonpan: (Death of Colonel Gardiner)</title1>

		<creator>Allan, William</creator>
		<description>Depicts the death of Colonel Gardiner at the Battle of Prestonpans (Waverley, ch. 18). The Battle of Prestonpans (September 21, 1745) saw Charles Edward Stuart's Jacobite army defeat Sir John Cope's Hanoverian troups. It is depicted in Sir Walter Scott's novel Waverley (1814), where the eponymous hero deserts Colonel Gardiner's Hanoverian dragoons to join the Jacobites. Scott thus describes the fall of Gardiner (a real-life figure): 'Waverley, as he cast his eyes towards this scene of smoke and slaughter, observed Colonel Gardiner, deserted by his own soldiers in spite of all his attempts to rally them, yet spurring his horse through the field to take the command of a small body of infantry... Waverley could perceive that he had already received many wounds, his clothes and saddle being marked with blood. To save this good and brave man, became the instant object of his most anxious exertions. But he could only witness his fall. Ere Edward could make his way among the Highlanders, who, furious and eager for spoil, now thronged upon each other, he saw his former commander brought from his horse by the blow of a scythe, and beheld him receive, while on the ground, more wounds than would have let out twenty lives.' The battle and Gardiner's death are also described in Tales of a Grandfather, Third Series (1829).</description>

The scene on the back cover illustrates the parting interview of Cleveland and Minna, with Minna's sister Brenda in the background and John Bunce, Cleveland's lieutenant looking on (ch. 40). It was engraved by (W.T.?) Green, probably after Robert Scott Lauder.</description>

		<description>Depicts the junction of West Bow and High Street, Edinburgh. Sir Walter Scott was born and raised in Edinburgh and worked there, first as an Advocate from 1792 to 1806, then as Clerk of the Court of Session until his retirement in 1830. The city features in many of his works, most notably The Heart of Mid-Lothian (1818). Scott gives a description and historical account of the High Street in Provincial Antiquities and Picturesque Scenery of Scotland (1826), noting, not uncritically, the many innovations made during his own lifetime. The view of the High Street presented in this engraving was only made possible by the demolition of the Old Tolbooth and Luckenbooths in 1817. These buildings had previously stood between the Lawnmarket and the High Street proper. Scott still maintained that 'under all its mutilations, the High Street of Edinburgh is the most magnificent in Great Britain, excepting perhaps the High Street of Oxford'.</description>

		<creator>Harding, James Duffield</creator>
		<description>Presents a view from Goatfell across the Isle of Arran. In Canto IV of Sir Walter Scott's The Lord of the Isles (1815) Robert the Bruce sets sail for Arran where his forces are to assemble: 'Now launched once more, the inland sea | They furrow with fair augury, | And steer for Arran's isle; | The sun, ere yet he sunk behind | Ben-Ghoil, "the Mountain of the Wind," | Gave his grim peaks a greeting kind, | And bade Loch Ranza smile.' (stanza 12, lines 1-7). Ben Ghoil is the Gaelic name for Goatfell. Scott had himself visited Arran in September 1814 when he joined a party of Commissioners for the Northern Lighthouse Service on a voyage of inspection around the coast of Scotland. Arran is also described in chapter 41 of The Heart of Midlothian (1818) as abounding 'with the grandest and most romantic scenery'.</description>

Osbaldistone, the narrator, describes his first impression of the building in chapter 18: 'The pile is of a gloomy and massive, rather than of an elegant, style of Gothic architecture; but its peculiar character is so strongly preserved, and so well suited with the accompaniments that surround it, that the impression of the first view was awful and solemn in the extreme.' This engraving possibly depicts the (successful) efforts of the tradesmen of Glasgow to prevent the Cathedral from being demolished at the Reformation.

		<creator>Dickes, William</creator>
		<description>Title page of Waverley, volume I in a set of the Waverley Novels published by A. and C. Black, featuring Colonel MacDonell in full Highland dress. Scott is thought to have based many of the traits of the Highland chieftain Fergus MacIvor in Waverley (1814) on his friend Alasdair (or Alexander) Ranaldson MacDonell, 15th Chief of Glengarry. Scott described him thus in his Journal (14 February 1826): 'This gentleman is a kind of Quixote in our age, having retained, in their full extent, the whole feelings of clanship and chieftainship, elsewhere so long abandoned. He seems to have lived a century too late, and to exist, in a state of complete law and order, like a Glengarry of old, whose will was law to his sept. Warmhearted, generous, friendly, he is beloved by those who know him, and his efforts are unceasing to show kindness to those of his clan who are disposed fully to admit his pretensions. To dispute them is to incur his resentment, which has sometimes broken out in acts of violence which have brought him into collision with the law. To me he is a treasure, as being full of information as to the history of his own clan, and the manners and customs of the Highlanders in general.' Glengarry gifted Scott the deerhounds Maida (1816) and Nimrod (1824). The original wood engraving was made for the Abbotsford edition of the Waverley Novels (1842-1847).</description>

The Castle is also mentioned in other novels by Scott, notably The Heart of Midlothian (1818), and is described in his Provincial Antiquities and Picturesque Scenery of Scotland (1826). It was also at Edinburgh Castle that on 4 February 1818 Scott helped discover the lost Regalia (or Crown Jewels) of Scotland.

Scott visited Caerlaverock Castle (built by the Maxwells in the 13th century) with Guthrie Wright in 1806. The original wood engraving was made for the Abbotsford edition of the Waverley Novels (1842-47).</description>

		<description>Title page of Guy Mannering, volume IV of a set of the Waverley Novels published by A. and C. Black, depicting Writer's Court, Edinburgh. In chapter 7 of Guy Mannering (1815), Mannering and Dandie Dinmont seek the lawyer Counsellor Pleydell in Clerihugh's Tavern, Edinburgh, and find him engaged in a game of 'High Jinks'. Clerihugh's Tavern was a real-life locale where the lawyers and magistrates of Edinburgh transacted much of their business in the 18th century. The original wood engraving, probably based on the work of Joseph Noel Paton, was made for the Abbotsford edition of the Waverley Novels (1842-47).</description>

St Ruth's Priory, scene of a number of important episodes in Sir Walter Scott's The Antiquary (1816), is often thought to be based on the 12th-century Arbroath Abbey. Scott visited Arbroath in September 1796. The original wood engraving was made for the Abbotsford edition of the Waverley Novels (1842-1847). The artist is Patrick Allan-Fraser who assumed his wife's surname of Fraser on his marriage in 1843.</description>

		<description>Title page of The Antiquary, volume VI of a set of the Waverley Novels published by A. and C. Black, depicting Mr Constable's cabinet. Sir Walter Scott himself acknowledged that Jonathan Oldbuck, the titular character of The Antiquary (1816), was based partly on a family friend George Constable who first introduced Scott to Shakespeare. In his unfinished Autobiography (1808), Scott wrote: 'He used always to dine at my father's house of a Sunday, and was authorized to turn the conversation out of the austere and Calvinistic tone, which it usually maintained on that day, upon subjects of history or auldlangsyne. He rememberd the forty-five, and told many excellent stories, all with a strong dash of a peculiar caustic humour.' The original wood engraving was made for the Abbotsford Edition of the Waverley Novels (1842-47). The artist is Patrick Allan-Fraser who assumed his wife's surname of Fraser on his marriage in 1843.</description>

		<description>Title page of The Black Dwarf, volume IX of a set of the Waverley Novels published by A. and C. Black, depicting David Ritchie, real-life model for the dwarf of the title. As Sir Walter Scott himself acknowledged in his introduction to the 'Magnum Opus' edition of The Black Dwarf (1830), the character of Elshender the Recluse was based on a real-life hermit David Ritchie. Scott had visited Ritchie's cottage while staying with his friend Captain Adam Ferguson in Peeblesshire in 1797. The Gilbert portrait of David Ritchie was originally published in the Scot's Magazine 1817. The original wood engraving, probably by Thomas Gilks after John Gilbert, was made for the Abbotsford edition of the Waverley Novels (1842-1847).</description>

		<description>Title page of Old Mortality, volume X of a set of the Waverley Novels published by A. and C. Black, depicting James Sharp, Archbishop of St Andrews (1613-1679). In ch. 5-6 of Sir Walter Scott's Old Mortality (1816), the hero Henry Morton shelters John Burley of Balfour who is wanted for his part in the assassination of James Sharp, Archbishop of St Andrews (3 May 1679). Sharp was detested by the Covenanters for betraying the Presbyterian cause and playing a major role in the reintroduction of Episcopacy and oppression of the Covenanting party. In Tales of a Grandfather, Second Series (1829), Scott wrote of Sharp: 'He had some virtues, being learned, temperate, and living a life becoming his station; but his illiberal and intolerant principles, and the violences which he committed to enforce them, were the cause of great distress to Scotland, and of his own premature and bloody end.' The Dickes portrait of Archbishop Sharp is based on a 17th-century portrait by Sir Peter Lely. The wood engraving was originally made for the Abbotsford Edition of the Waverley Novels (1842-1847).</description>

		<description>Title page of Old Mortality, volume XI of a set of the Waverley Novels published by A. and C. Black, featuring General Thomas Dalyell (1615-1685). Commander-in-Chief of the army in Scotland from 1661 to 1685, General Thomas Dalyell earned the epithet 'Bluidy Tam' after his suppression of the Covenanters at Rullion Green in 1666. In Old Mortality (1816) Scott describes him as 'as much feared for his cruelty and indifference to human life and human sufferings, as respected for his steady loyalty and undaunted valour'. The General also appears as a demonic ghost in 'Wandering Willie's Tale' in Redgauntlet (1824). The Dickes portrait appears to be based on an original portrait by David Paton (fl. 1660-1698). The wood engraving was originally made for the Abbotsford Edition of the Waverley Novels (1842-1847).</description>

		<description>Title page of The Heart of Midlothian, vol. XIII of a set of the Waverley Novels published by A. and C. Black, featuring John Campbell, 2nd Duke of Argyll (1678-1743). In Sir Walter Scott's The Heart of Mid-Lothian (1818), the Duke of Argyll assists Jeanie Deans in seeking the aid of Queen Caroline and ultimately provides a home on his estates for the heroine and her husband Reuben Butler. Scott wrote that 'few names deserve more honourable mention in the history of Scotland' than the Duke; he 'was alike free from the ordinary vices of statesmen, falsehood, namely, and dissimulation; and from those of warriors, inordinate and violent thirst after self-aggrandisement' (The Heart of Mid-Lothian, ch. 34). The original wood engraving, probably after William Lodge, was made for the Abbotsford Edition of the Waverley Novels (1842-1847).</description>

		<creator>Dickes, William</creator>
		<description>Title page of The Bride of Lammermoor, volume XIV of a set of the Waverley Novels published by A. and C. Black, depicting Queen Anne (1665-1714). Sir Walter Scott's The Bride of Lammermoor (1819) is set during the reign of Queen Anne in the years immediately preceding the Act of Union between England and Scotland (1707). The novel takes place at a time when the Jacobite party appears to be in the ascendant on both sides of the Border in the expectation that the Queen would be succeeded by her brother James (later known as the 'Old Pretender'). The Dickes portrait derives from a portrait by Sir Godfrey Kneller (ca. 1690) probably via the intermediary of earlier engravings. The wood engraving was originally made for the Abbotsford Edition of the Waverley Novels (1842-1847).</description>

		<description>Title page of A Legend of Montrose, volume XV of a set of the Waverley Novels published by A. and C. Black, depicting Archibald Campbell, 1st Marquis of Argyll (1607-1661). Sir Walter Scott's A Legend of Montrose (1819) is set during the campaign of James Graham, Earl of Montrose, against the Covenanters in the Highlands in 1644-1645. The Marquis of Argyll met Montrose in a series of battles, finally defeating him at Philiphaugh in 1645. Scott describes Argyll as 'a man rather of political enterprise than personal courage, and better calculated to manage an intrigue of state, than to control the tribes of hostile mountaineers' (A Legend of Montrose, ch. 1). The Dickes portrait of the Marquis of Argyll is drawn from an 'old print', possibly a 1713 engraving by Michael Vandergucht after an unknown artist. The original wood engraving was made for the Abbotsford edition of the Waverley Novels (1842-1847).</description>

The Jewish financier Isaac and his daughter Rebecca are both natives of the county-town York. Micklegate (or 'great street') was the principal thoroughfare of medieval York. The original wood engraving was made for the Abbotsford edition of the Waverley Novels (1842-1847).</description>

		<description>Title page of Ivanhoe, volume XVII of a set of the Waverley Novels published by A. and C. Black, depicting the Corona of Canterbury Cathedral, Kent. This image depicts the 'Corona' or the east end of Canterbury Cathedral, named after the severed crown of St Thomas Becket (St. Thomas the Martyr), who was assassinated in the cathedral in 1170. The Corona was built to contain a shrine to St Thomas, which was subsequently destroyed on the orders of Henry VIII in 1540. St Thomas' name is used in many oaths in Walter Scott's Ivanhoe (1819). Prince John also despairs about the loyalty of his men: "An unhappy prince am I. My father, King Henry, had faithful servants---He had but to say that he was plagued with a factious priest, and the blood of Thomas-a-Becket, saint though he was, stained the steps of his own altar" (ch. 11). The original wood engraving was made for the Abbotsford Edition of the Waverley Novels (1842-1847). The engraving by Jewitt is presumably after his own design.</description>

Sir Walter Scott's The Monastery (1820) in the years following the death of James V, when Lowland Scotland was devastated by Henry VIII of England's 'Rough Wooing'. That is the term that Scott coined to describe Henry's military campaign (1544-1551) to bring about the marriage of the infant Mary Queen of Scots and his own son Edward Prince of Wales. This portrait is taken from a 16th-century carving made for the King's Presence Chamber in Stirling Castle (one of the 'Stirling Heads'). The original wood engraving was made for the Abbotsford Edition of the Waverley Novels (1842-1847).</description>

		<description>Title page of The Monastery, volume XIX of a set of the Waverley Novels published by A. and C. Black, depicting Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset (ca. 1500-1552). Somerset was Lord Protector of England from 1547 to 1549, ruling the country in the name of the boy king Edward VI. As Warden of the Scottish Marshes, he continued to prosecute the war of 'Rough Wooing', which was designed to bring about the marriage of Edward and the infant Mary Queen of Scots. The Scots suffered a particularly devastating defeat at his hands at the Battle of Pinkie Cleugh (1547). In Sir Walter Scott's The Monastery (1820), the father of Halbert and Edward Glendinning has been killed at the battle, and Somerset is depicted encamped at Roxburgh Castle demanding tribute from the Scots (ch. 2). The original wood engraving, probably by Charles Green, was made for the Abbotsford Edition of the Waverley Novels (1842-1847).</description>

		<description>Title page of The Abbot, volume XX of a set of the Waverley Novels published by A. and C. Black, depicting John Knox (ca. 1514-1572). Scott never portrayed John Knox directly in his fiction, but his 1820 novels The Monastery and The Abbot portray the triumph of the Knox-inspired Reformation in Scotland. Scott's preacher Henry Warden is presented as second only in power and eloquence to Knox. In The Abbot even the Catholic Mary Queen of Scots salutes Knox's power, describing him as 'the ablest and most powerful of heresiarchs' (ch. 25). Scott also described Knox's role in the Reformation in the historical Tales of a Grandfather, First Series (1828), where Knox is introduced as 'a man of great courage, zeal, and talents' and as the 'bold and inflexible father of the Scottish Reformation'. For each of these works, Knox's own Historie of the Reformation of the Church of Scotland was an important source. The original wood engraving was made for the Abbotsford edition of the Waverley Novels (1842-1847), where it was used to illustrate The Monastery. It was engraved by John Orrin Smith and William James Linton after a drawing by William Dickes. Dickes's drawing was based on one of several earlier prints all ultimately deriving from a portrait by Adrian Van Son (ca. 1580).</description>

		<description>Title page of The Abbot, volume XXI of a set of the Waverley Novels published by A. and C. Black, depicting Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley (1545-1567) as a child. Following the murder of Lord Darnley, second husband of Mary Queen of Scots (1567), and Mary's subsequent remarriage to the Earl of Bothwell, the Scottish Lords confronted the Queen and imprisoned her in Loch Leven Castle. Her escape from captivity is the subject of Walter Scott's The Abbot (1820). In ch. 22 of the novel she proclaims herself innocent of involvement in the murder of Darnley, but acknowledge that by marrying the chief suspect she has laid herself open to suspicion. The original wood engraving was made for the Abbotsford Edition of the Waverley Novels (1842-1847) by a member of the Dalziel family of engravers, possibly George (1815-1902). It derives ultimately from a late 16th- or early 17th-century engraving by Renold Elstrack.</description>

		<description>Title page of Kenilworth, volume XXIII of a set of the Waverley Novels published by A. and C. Black, depicting Thomas Radcliffe, 3rd Earl of Sussex (ca. 1525-1583). Thomas Radcliffe was Earl of Sussex, not Essex as indicated here. Under Queen Elizabeth, he served as Lord Lieutenant of Ireland (1559-1564) and Lord Chamberlain (1572-1583). His court rivalry with Robert Dudley, Earl of Leicester, forms the backdrop to Sir Walter Scott's Kenilworth (1821). Radcliffe wished Elizabeth to marry a non-English bridegroom and was thus hostile to Dudley's own ambitions to marry the Queen. The original wood engraving was made for the Abbotsford Edition of the Waverley Novels (1842-1847). It derives from a 16th-century painting by an unknown artist.</description>

		<description>Title page of The Pirate, volume XXIV of a set of the Waverley Novels published by A. and C. Black, depicting St. Magnus Cathedral, Kirkwall, Orkney. In Sir Walter Scott's The Pirate (1821), St. Magnus Cathedral in Kirkwall, Orkney, is the scene of decisive encounters between Captain Cleveland and Minna Troil (ch. 37) and between Mordaunt Mertoun and Ulla Troil (ch. 41). Scott, who had visited Orkney in 1814, described the Cathedral as 'of the heaviest order of Gothic architecture, but grand, solemn, and stately, the work of a distant age, and of a powerful hand' (The Pirate, ch. 31). The original wood engraving was made for the Abbotsford Edition of the Waverley Novels (1842-1847). There the engraving itself gives the artist's name as Dickes and the engraver as Mary A. Williams, but the list of illustrations gives the artist's name as Elizabeth Leveson-Gower, Duchess-Countess of Sutherland.</description>

In Sir Walter Scott's The Pirate (1821), the self-style prophetess Ulla Troil inhabits a pictish fort or broch on Fitful Head, Shetland. No such structure exists on Fitful Head, and Scott is generally thought to have modelled her imaginary dwelling on the nearby brochs of Mousa and Culswick (the latter portrayed here). Scott visited Shetland in 1814 when he joined a party of Commissioners for the Northern Lighthouse Service on a voyage of inspection around the coast of Scotland. The original wood engraving was made for the Abbotsford Edition of the Waverley Novels (1842-1847).</description>

George Heriot, Goldsmith and Jeweller to James VI, is portrayed as 'Jingling Geordie' in Sir Walter Scott's 1822 novel The Fortunes of Nigel. George Heriot's School, Edinburgh, formerly George Heriot's Hospital, was founded in 1628 as a result of a bequest from Heriot. The statue of Heriot in the school's Quadrangle was carved in 1693 by Robert Mylne (1633-1710) who based the likeness on a painting by Paul Van Somer. This engraving, obtained glyphographically be Edward Palmer, was originally made for the Abbotsford Edition of the Waverley Novels (1842-1847).</description>

		<description>Title page of The Fortunes of Nigel, volume XXVII of a set of the Waverley Novels published by A. and C. Black, depicting the George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham (1592-1628). Buckingham appears as the omnipotent favourite of both King James VI and I and the Prince of Wales in Sir Walter Scott's The Fortunes of Nigel (1822). Scott describes him as 'more feared than beloved, and, if not absolutely of a tyrannical disposition [...] accounted haughty, violent, and vindictive' (ch. 6). The original wood engraving was made for the Abbotsford Edition of the Waverley Novels (1842-1847).

His father Sir Geoffrey Peveril had earlier been imprisoned in the same gaol on suspicion of involvement in the Popish Plot (1678).

		<description>Title page of Peveril of the Peak, volume XXIX of a set of the Waverley Novels published by A. and C. Black, depicting Margaret Cavendish, Duchess of Newcastle (1661-1717). In Walter Scott's Peveril of the Peak (1823), the Duchess of Newcastle is mentioned on several occasions as a friend of the Countess of Derby. She attracts the ridicule of the Earl of Derby and of King Charles II who describes her as 'an entire raree-show in her own person--a universal masquerade--indeed a sort of private Bedlam-hospital' (ch. 45). To this day, the Duchess divides opinion, some hailing her as a pioneering woman writer, others concurring with Pepys that she was 'mad, conceited and ridiculous'. Scott clearly inclined to the latter view. The original wood engraving, probably by John Thompson, was made for the Abbotsford Edition of the Waverley Novels (1842-47). It derives, probably via earlier engravings, from an original painting by Abraham Diepenbeeck.</description>

		<description>Title page of Peveril of the Peak, volume XXX of a set of the Waverley Novels published by A. and C. Black, depicting Haddon Hall with lit beacon. Martindale Castle, ancient seat of the Peverils in Sir Walter Scott's Peveril of the Peak (1823), is generally thought to be modelled on Haddon Hall, Derbyshire, a fortified medieval manor house belonging to the Manners family. The original wood engraving, probably by Charles Green, was made for the Abbotsford Edition of the Waverley Novels (1842-1847).</description>

		<description>Title page of Quentin Durward, volume XXXI of a set of the Waverley Novels published by A. and C. Black, depicting P̩ronne, Somme, France. In Sir Walter Scott's Quentin Durward (1823), Charles the Bold, Duke of Burgundy makes his camp at P̩ronne. He is unexpectedly visited there by his enemy Louis XI who, by feigning friendliness, hopes to allay suspicions that he has backed a revolt against Charles's brother-in-law, the Bishop of Li̬ge. Charles sees through Louis's ploy and imprisons him. The King is finally, however, able to persuade Charles of his innocence and regain liberty. Scott himself passed through P̩ronne when travelling from Belgium to France in 1815. The original wood engraving, probably by Walter George Mason, was made for the Abbotsford Edition of the Waverley Novels (1842-1847).</description>

		<description>Title page of Quentin Durward, volume XXXII of a set of the Waverley Novels published by A. and C. Black, depicting St Joan of Valois (1464-1505). Joan (or Jeanne), Duchess of Berry was the second daughter of Louis XI by his second wife Charlotte of Savoy. For dynastic purposes, Louis compelled her to marry his second cousin Louis duc d'Orl̩ans, later Louis XII. Divorced by Louis XII on his ascent to the throne, she went on to found the religious order of the Annonciades and was canonized by Pius XII. In Sir Walter Scott's Quentin Durward (1823), the duc d'Orl̩ans's passion for Isabelle de Croye threatens to thwart Louis IX's plans to marry him to her daughter. Scott describes Joan as 'pale, thin, and sickly in her complexion; her shape visibly bent to one side, and her gait [...] so unequal that she might be called lame'. In terms of appearance, eyes 'expressive of melancholy, softness, and resignation' were her only 'redeeming points'. The original wood engraving was made for the Abbotsford Edition of the Waverley Novels (1842-1847).</description>

Niel (or Neil) Gow was the most celebrated Scottish fiddler of the 18th century. His son Nathaniel (1766-1831), a first-rate musician and composer in his own right, plays during the theatricals at Shaws-Castle in Sir Walter Scott's St Ronan's Well (1823). Touchwood comments: 'He is his father's own son [...]. It is many a long year since I listened to old Neil at Inver, and, to say truth, spent a night with him over pancakes and Athole brose; and I never expected to hear his match again in my lifetime' (ch. 20).

		<description>Title page of The Betrothed, volume XXXVII of a set of the Waverley Novels published by A. and C. Black, depicting the Bishop's Palace, Gloucester. In ch. 18 of Sir Walter Scott's The Betrothed (1825), Hugo de Lacy meets Baldwin, Archbishop of Canterbury, in the Bishop's Palace at Gloucester. Scott is guilty here of an anachronism. There was no Diocese of Gloucester in the twelfth century, the period in which the novel is set. The fourteenth-century building portrayed here only became the Bishop's Palace in 1542 when Henry VIII created the Diocese. Previously it had been the residence of the Abbot of the Benedictine Abbey of St. Peter. The original wood engraving, probably by J. J. Field, was made for the Abbotsford Edition of the Waverley Novels (1842-1847).</description>

		<description>Title page of Woodstock, volume XXXIX of a set the Waverley Novels published by A. and C. Black, depicting General George Monck (1608-1670). In ch. 38 of Sir Walter Scott's Woodstock (1826) news reaches the exiled Royal Court at Brussels that General Monck (or Monk) is marching South from Scotland, a move that would bring about the restoration of the Stewart dynasty. Having initially fought on the Royal side, Monck had become one of Cromwell's most trusted generals and his deputy in Scotland. On Cromwell's death, he pledged to support Cromwell's son and successor Richard. As the country descended into chaos, however, he acted to restore the monarchy. The original wood engraving was made for the Abbotsford Edition of the Waverley Novels (1842-47). According to the contents page of the Abbotsford Edition, the illustration was engraved by 'Nugent' after 'Chapman'. However, the image is clearly signed 'W. Dickes' and was probably derived from one or more pre-existing engraved portraits.</description>

		<description>Title page of The Fair Maid of Perth, volume XLII of a set of the Waverley Novels published by A. and C. Black, depicting the Perth Bridge. Describing Perth in ch. I of The Fair Maid of Perth (1828), Sir Walter Scott regrets the demolition in 1809 of Gowrie House or Tower, the scene of the alleged 'Gowrie Conspiracy' against James VI in 1600. The bridge portrayed here was built in 1771 and is therefore not the one featured in the novel which was destroyed by a flood in 1621. The original wood engraving, possibly by Edward Evans, was made for the Abbotsford edition of the Waverley Novels (1842-1847).</description>

		<description>Title page of The Fair Maid of Perth, volume XLIII of a set of the Waverley Novels published by A. and C. Black, depicting Abernethy Round Tower, Perthshire. The Round Tower of Abernethy (near Perth) was built in the ninth century and is one of only two such towers in Scotland. Over 70 feet tall, it was built by monks from the nearby monastery and has served as a place of refuge, a belfry, and a burial chamber. Scott described the Tower in a letter to his son Walter on 14 November 1820 and in a review of Joseph Ritson's Annals of the Caledonians, Picts, and Scots for the Quarterly Review in July 1829. The original wood engraving, by William Dickes after Noel Paton, was made for the Abbotsford edition of the Waverley Novels (1842-1847).</description>

The legend of William Tell is constantly invoked throughout Sir Walter Scott's Anne of Geierstein (1829). The caption to this engraving is a little misleading. The monument to Tell is not the tower but the statue overlooking the fountain. It was created in 1786 by Benedikt Curiger and removed in 1859 to make way for a new monument.

Sir Walter Scott's Count Robert of Paris (1831) is set in Constantinople during the reign of the Byzantine Emperor Alexius Comnenus (1081-1118). It begins with a brief history of the city which mentions the additions and improvements made by the Emperor Theodosius I (378-395). It was Theodosius who brought to Constantinople the Egyptian obelisk of Pharaoh Thutmosi III now known as the Column of Theodosius.

In his Memoirs of the Life of Sir Walter Scott, Bart. (1837-1838), Scott's son-in-law J. G. Lockhart describes the return of the dying Scott to Abbotsford on 11 July 1832 after a lengthy stay on the Continent. Scott begins to revive from a state of torpor as his carriage descends the Vale of Gala, and he murmurs, 'Gala Water, surely -- Buckholm --Torwoodlee'.

		<description>Depicts Manor Valley, Scottish Borders, with bridge and ruined tower. In the Introduction to Magnum Opus edition of The Black Dwarf (1830), Walter Scott recounts the tale of David Ritchie, the inspiration for the eponymous character: 'Tired at length of being the object of shouts, laughter, and derision, David Ritchie resolved, like a deer hunted from the herd, to retreat to some wilderness... He settled himself, with this view, upon a patch of wild moorland at the bottom of a bank on the farm of Woodhouse, in the sequestered vale of the small river Manor, in Peeblesshire.' Scott himself visited Ritchie's cottage while staying with his friend Captain Adam Ferguson in Peeblesshire in 1797.

In ch. 49 of Sir Walter Scott's The Heart of Midlothian (1818), Lady Staunton (the former Effie Deans) becomes trapped while visiting a waterfall in the vicinity of Gairloch (Ross and Cromarty). The artist has chosen a spot matching the description: 'A single shoot carried a considerable stream over the face of a black rock, which contrasted strongly in colour with the white foam of the cascade, and, at the depth of about twenty feet, another rock intercepted the view of the bottom of the fall. The water, wheeling out far beneath, swept round the crag, which thus bounded their view, and tumbled down the rocky glen in a torrent of foam.'

Sir Walter Scott celebrated its scenery in the novel Rob Roy (1817) and poem The Lady of the Lake (1810), spawning an enduring tourist industry.

Fast Castle, near St Abbs Head, Berwickshire, has been identified as an inspiration for Wolf's Crag, the home of the Master of Ravenswood in Sir Walter Scott's The Bride of Lammermoor (1819). In the Magnum Opus edition of the novel (1830), Scott claims that he cannot comment on the perceived resemblance between Wolf's Crag and Fast Castle as he has only seen the latter from the sea. He acknowledges, however, that the position of Fast Castle resembles that of Wolf's Crag. Scott owned a painting of Fast Castle by the Rev. John Thomson (Letters, VIII, 459), quite possibly the one engraved here. The original steel engraving was made for the Abbotsford Edition of the Waverley Novels (1842-1847).</description>

The village is described as 'a rude assemblage of huts, with a very few stone mansions interspersed, stretching upwards from the banks of Loch Fine to the principal gate of the castle'. Extensively rebuilt in 1745, by Scott's age it had become 'a neat country town'. There are further references to Inverary as the seat of the Duke of Argyll in The Heart of Mid-Lothian (1818).

		<creator>Stanfield, Clarkson</creator>
		<description>Depicts the town of Melrose, Scottish Borders, and the ruins of Melrose Abbey with a quarry in the foreground. Sir Walter Scott coordinated the restoration of Melrose Abbey in 1822. The Abbey features in many of Scott's works, most famously The Lay of the Last Minstrel (1805): 'If thou would'st view fair Melrose aright, | Go visit it by the pale moonlight [...] | Then view St. David's ruin'd pile; | And, home returning, soothly swear, | Was never scene so sad and fair!' (canto II, stanza I, lines 1-2, 16-18). The religious house of Kennaquhair in The Monastery and The Abbot (both 1820) is also based on the Abbey, and it is described in detail in Scott's 'Essay on Border Antiquities' (1814). The original steel engraving was made for the Abbotsford Edition of the Waverley Novels (1842-1847).</description>

In Walter Scott's The Fortunes of Nigel (1822), the hero Nigel Olifaunt, Lord Glenvarloch travels to the court of King James VI and I at Whitehall, in order to reclaim a sum of money lent to the King by his father. The palace was then undergoing a major modernization at the hands of Inigo Jones.

		<creator>Penson, Richard Kyrke</creator>
		<description>Depicts a traveller making his way through the Llanberis Pass, Wales, with Dolbadern Castle in the background. Sir Walter Scott's The Betrothed (1824) is a tale of Anglo-Welsh Border conflict set in the Welsh Marches. In ch. 9 an Anglo-Norman force lifts the siege of the castle of Garde Douleureuse. The defeated Welsh army are seen fleeing through the pass protected by the Castle: 'The single pass by which they could cross to the other side was soon completely choked by fugitives, on whose rear raged the swords of the victorious Normans. Many threw themselves into the river, upon the precarious chance of gaining the farther side, and, except a few, who were uncommonly strong, skilful, and active, perished among the rocks and in the currents'. To illustrate this scene, R. K. Penson has chosen to portray Dolbadern Castle and the Llanberis Pass, although neither is geographically close to the Welsh Marches. The original steel engraving was made for the Abbotsford Edition of the Waverley Novels (1842-1847).</description>

		<description>Depicts a ferry crossing Lake Windermere, Cumbria. This engraving illustrates a passage in ch. 16 of Sir Walter Scott's Guy Mannering (1815), where Julia Mannering is serenaded by Henry Bertram on an (unnamed) Westmorland lake. Scott met his wife Charlotte when holidaying in the Lake District in 1797. He made further visits to the region in 1805, 1813, and 1825.

		<description>Depicts Bolton Moor, Cumbria, with Skiddaw and Saddleback mountains in the background. In ch. 22 of Guy Mannering (1815), Sir Walter Scott describes the hero Henry Bertram setting out on foot from Cumbria to Scotland: 'Let the reader conceive to himself a clear frosty November morning, the scene an open heath,--having for the background that huge chain of mountains in which Skiddaw and Saddleback are pre-eminent.' Scott met his wife Charlotte when holidaying in the Lake District in 1797. He made further visits to the region in 1805, 1813, and 1825. The original steel engraving was made for the Abbotsford Edition of the Waverley Novels (1842-1847).</description>

		<description>Depicts the River Tay and the waterfront of Dundee. Sir Walter Scott himself acknowledged that Jonathan Oldbuck, the titular character of The Antiquary (1816), was based partly on a family friend George Constable who first introduced Scott to Shakespeare. Constable was a native of Dundee, and Oldbuck's house of Monkbarns is sometimes thought to be based on Constable's estate of Craigie Wallace. The original steel engraving was made for the Abbotsford Edition of the Waverley Novels (1842-1847).</description>

		<title1>The Portrait Engraved by Woolnoth and the Emblematical Design by Hawksworth</title1>
		<title2>Engraved portrait of Walter Scott by T. Woolnoth after A. Geddes, with ornamental frieze by J. Hawkesworth</title2>
		<creator>Geddes, Andrew (b.1783, d.1844)</creator>
		<description>Engraved portrait of Walter Scott (aged forty-seven or forty-eight), surrounded by a Gothic border with vignettes taken from his poems. The original portrait by Andrew Geddes began life as a study for his The Discovery of the Regalia of Scotland (1821). The sitting took place some time between 4 February 1818, the date of the discovery of the Regalia, and the beginning of 1819 when Scott fell seriously ill. The portrait suggests that Scott's health is already deteriorating. Originally purchased by the collector Sir James Stuart, 7th Baronet of Allanbank, the picture now hangs in the Scottish National Portrait Gallery. Woolnoth's engraving is after a drawing by Geddes himself, or possibly after an earlier engraving by F.C. Lewis (1824). The ornamental frieze by Hawkesworth features scenes from Scott's poems, some based on illustrations by Richard Westall. Scott had not yet publicly acknowledged authorship of the Waverley Novels (he would do so in 1827).</description>

		<description>Engraved portrait of a seated Walter Scott with his dog Maida. This engraved portrait by Robert Jacob Hamerton (fl. 1831-1858) was published by J. M. M'Cormack, London, in 1832. The 'original sketch' has not been identified. The face bears a close resemblance to that in Charles Robert Leslie's 1824 portrait of Scott, especially as engraved by M. I. Danforth in 1829.</description>

One formed the basis for this etching executed in 1817 by Nicholson himself. The only significant difference between the watercolour and the etching is that Scott's dog Maida has been moved somewhat to the right, leaving more of Scott's waistcoat visible.</description>

		<title1>[Walter Scott]: Etched by W. Mayor after a Sketch by Edwin Landseer</title1>
		<title2>Facsimile of etched portrait of Walter Scott by W. Mayor after E. Landseer</title2>
		<creator>Landseer, Edwin (b.1802, d.1873)</creator>
		<description>Facsimile of etched profile portrait of Walter Scott. The etching by W. Mayor was taken from a portrait now in the collection of the Dower House Gallery, Boughton House. According to Algernon Graves, the portrait was painted in 1831 (Catalogue of the Works of the Late Sir Edwin Landseer, no. 163). There is no record of Scott sitting for Landseer in that year, but Scott appears markedly older than in sketches made by Landseer in 1824. Francis Russell agrees that it is 'not unreasonable' to suggest that Landseer may have seen Scott in 1831, but argues that Landseer nonetheless referred to his earlier sketches of Scott (Portraits of Sir Walter Scott, no. 113). The etching by Mayor was published in 1832.</description>

		<creator>Phillips, Thomas</creator>
		<description>Engraved half-length portrait of Walter Scott, aged forty-four, with a plaid of Stuart tartan over his shoulders. The dating of the half-length portrait of Scott made by Thomas Phillips for the publisher John Murray remains uncertain. In his Memoirs of the Life of Sir Walter Scott, Bart. (2nd edn, 1839), J.G. Lockhart dates it to 1818, relying on information provided by Phillips himself. In his Portraits of Sir Walter Scott, however, Francis Russell argues that 1815 is more probable (no. 157). Scott did not, in fact, visit London in 1818 but spent ten weeks there in 1815, spending a good deal of time at John Murray's where he met Byron. The engraving by Fry was first published by Boys, 1 November 1820.</description>

The portrait by David Wilkie originated in 1824 as a sketch for The Entrance of King George the Fourth at Holyrood, where Scott was to figure among the King's attendants. It was subsequently worked up as an independent painting for Sir William Knighton in 1828. It was engraved by Edward Smith for Robert Cadell, Edinburgh, and Moon, Graves, and Boys, London, in 1829. In 1830, it was published as the frontispiece to vol. I of The Poetical Works of Sir Walter Scott.</description>

		<description>Engraved portrait of Scottish novelist Henry Mackenzie (1745-1831). Scott read Henry Mackenzie's novels in his youth and became his friend and colleague in adulthood.Mackenzie contributed to Walter Scott's Edinburgh Annual Register and both men were trustees of the Edinburgh Theatre. In 1823, Scott edited Mackenzie's fiction for Ballantyne's Novelists Library, and provided a biographical sketch of the author which was subsequently reprinted as one of his Lives of the Novelists. The original portrait by Watson Gordon was probably expressly painted to be engraved by Freeman for Chambers's Biographical Dictionary of Eminent Scotsmen (1835). It may have derived from an earlier portrait by Watson Gordon painted during Mackenzie's lifetime.</description>

		<description>Depicts Edith Plantagenet, heroine of Sir Walter Scott's novel The Talisman (1825), dressed as a Carmelite votaress with a chaplet of red and white roses. This portrait of Edith Plantagenet was inspired by a passage in ch. 4 of The Talisman in which Edith appears as a Carmelite novice: 'Six, who from their black scapularies, and black veils over their white garments, appeared to be professed nuns of the order of Mount Carmel; and as many whose veils, being white, argued them to be novices, or occasional inhabitants in the cloister, who were not as yet bound to it by vows. The former held in their hands large rosaries, while the younger and lighter figures who followed carried each a chaplet of red and white roses... one of the white-stoled maidens, as she glided by him, detached from the chaplet which she carried a rosebud, which dropped from her fingers, perhaps unconsciously, on the foot of Sir Kenneth.'</description>

		<description>Engraved half-length portrait of Scottish philosopher Dugald Stewart (1753-1828). Sir Walter Scott studied Moral Philosophy under Dugald Stewart at Edinburgh University in 1789-90. An exponent of the Scottish 'Common Sense' School of philosophy, Stewart greatly influenced Scott's views on history, human nature, and political ethics. At one stage good friends, the two men fell out following Scott's vehement support of Henry Dundas, Viscount Melville when he was impeached in 1806 for misappropriation of public money. The original portrait by Sir Henry Raeburn was painted ca. 1810.</description>

The portrait illustrates the line: 'In a moment, I think, of madness, I resolved to set out in this masculine disguise' (ch. 11). Lady Augusta, an English heiress, has promised to marry Sir John de Walton if he can defend the strategically vital Castle Douglas against the forces of Robert the Bruce and Sir James Douglas (the 'Black Douglas') for a year and a day. Increasingly alarmed, though, by the danger he is running, she travels to Douglasdale in masculine disguise. The scallop shell was the universally recognized badge of a pilgrim.</description>

Eveline's father, the Anglo-Norman Raymond Berenger, has refused her hand to the Welsh prince Gwenwyn, and the incensed Gwenwyn has laid siege to the Berengers' castle of Garde Douloureuse.</description>

Lochmaben Castle near Dumfries was the seat of the Bruce family in their capacity as Lords of Annandale and has been proposed by some historians as the birthplace of Robert the Bruce, hero of Sir Walter Scott's The Lord of the Isles (1815). Built in the 13th century, the castle lay in ruins by Scott's time. There are further references to Lochmaben Castle and the Bruces in Scott's The Monastery and The Abbot (both 1820) and in the traditional ballad 'The Lochmaben Harper' which Scott included in his Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border (1802-1803).</description>

		<description>Engraved half-length portrait of Scottish educationalist Alexander Adam (1741-1809). Alexander Adam was Rector of the High School of Edinburgh where Sir Walter Scott was educated from 1779 to 1783. One of the most innovative educators of his age, he sought to instil in his pupils not only a grasp of grammar but a sensitivity to literary language. With Adam's encouragement, the young Scott translated Horace and Virgil into English verse and made his first attempts at original composition. The original portrait was painted by Raeburn ca. 1808.</description>

		<title2>Engraving of a cave at Staffa by E. Goodall after J.W.M. Turner</title2>

		<description>Engraved title page for The Poetical Works of Walter Scott, vol. X, with image of Staffa, Inner Hebrides. Sir Walter Scott visited the Isle of Staffa in 1810 and declared it 'one of the most extraordinary places I ever beheld' which 'exceeded in my mind every description I had heard of it' (Letter to Joanna Baillie, July 19, 1810). He was particularly struck by Fingal's Cave: 'the appearance of the cavern composed entirely of basaltic pillars as high as the roof of a cathedral and running deep into the rock, eternally swept by a deep and swelling sea, and paved as it were with ruddy marble baffles all description'. He subsequently described Fingal's Cave in The Lord of the Isles (1815), canto IV, stanza X: 'that wondrous dome, | Where, as to shame the temples deck'd | By skill of earthly architect, | Nature herself, it seem'd, would raise | A Minster to her Maker's p raise!' (lines 13-17). The island and its caves are further celebrated in 'Lines Addressed to Ranald Macdonald, Esq. of Staffa' (1814).</description>

		<description>Engraved portrait depicting Janet Foster, lady-in-waiting to Amy Robsart in Sir Walter Scott's Kenilworth (1821). This portrait of Janet Foster is inspired by a passage in ch. 5 of the novel. Janet admires a string of pearls sent as a gift to Amy by her husband the Earl of Leicester: '"Surely, lady," said Janet, gazing with admiration at the neck-string of pearls, "the daughters of Tyre wore no fairer neck-jewels than these.

		<description>Engraved portrait of Fenella, confidante of the Countess of Derby in Sir Walter Scott's Peveril of the Peak (1823). This portrait is inspired by a passage in ch. 5 of the novel. Fenella, who has assumed the role of a deaf mute, attempts to warn Julian Peveril against keeping a rendezvous with Alice Bridgenorth: 'She proceeded to put him to the question by a series of gestures, which we will endeavour to describe. She commenced by extending her hand slightly, accompanied with the sharp inquisitive look which served her as a note of interrogation... Fenella looked grave, shook her head, and pointed to the Countess's window, which was visible from the spot where they stood.'</description>

		<title1>Francis Jeffrey: One of the Lords of Session</title1>
		<title2>Engraved portrait of Francis Jeffrey by G. Stodart after G. Hayter</title2>
		<creator>Hayter, George</creator>
		<description>Engraved profile portrait of the Scottish lawyer and critic Francis Jeffrey, Lord Jeffrey (1773-1850). Francis Jeffrey was one of the founders of the Edinburgh Review and responsible for asking his fellow advocate Walter Scott to contribute. The Review flourished with Jeffrey as editor, and he became a powerful and influential critic. Jeffrey reviewed a number of Scott's own works making few concessions to personal friendship. Scott was particularly hurt by his critique of Marmion (1808), feeling that it might have been couched 'in language rather more civil to a personal friend'. While entertaining the highest regard for Jeffrey's talents, Scott felt he lacked 'the taste for poetry which is essentially necessary to enjoy and of course to criticize it with justice', and specifically 'that enthusiastic feeling which like sun-shine upon a landscape lights up every beauty and palliates if it cannot hide ever defect' (letter to Joanna Baillie, 31 October 1808).</description>

		<creator>Parris, Edmund Thomas</creator>
		<description>Engraved portrait of Hermione, a character in Scott's Anne of Geierstein (1829). This portrait of Hermione, a learned Persian woman who acts as tutor to the Baron of Arnheim in Anne of Geierstein, was inspired by the following passage in ch. 11 of the novel: 'The silver lamp was extinguished, or removed from its pedestal, where stood in place of it a most beautiful female figure in the Persian costume, in which the color of pink predominated. But she wore no turban or head-dress of any kind, saving a blue ribbon drawn through her auburn hair, and secured by a gold clasp, the outer side of which was ornamented by a superb opal [...]. The little lady's countenance was of a lively and expressive character, in which spirit and wit seemed to predominate; and the quick dark eye, with its beautifully formed eyebrow, seemed to presage the arch remark, to which the rosy and half smiling lip appeared ready to give utterance.'</description>

		<creator>Rochard, Simon Jacques</creator>
		<description>Engraved profile portrait of Countess Isabelle de Croye, heroine of Scott's Quentin Durward (1823). This portrait of Isabelle de Croye is inspired by the eponymous hero's first glimpse of her: 'He speedily made the discovery that a quantity of long black tresses, which, in the maiden fashion of his own country, were unadorned by any ornament, except a single chaplet lightly woven out of ivy leaves, formed a veil around a countenance which, in its regular features, dark eyes, and pensive expression, resembled that of Melpomene, though there was a faint glow on the cheek, and an intelligence on the lips and in the eye, which made it seem that gaiety was not foreign to a countenance so expressive, although it might not be its most habitual expression.'

		<creator>Crombie, Benjamin William</creator>
		<description>Engraved profile portrait of Scottish mathematician, scientist, and prolific inventor Sir John Leslie (1766-1832). In 1808 Sir Walter Scott engaged Sir John Leslie, Professor of Mathematics at Edinburgh University, to contribute scientific articles to the Edinburgh Annual Register. Writing to George Ellis, Scott described Leslie as 'a great philosopher, and as abominable an animal as I ever saw', adding that 'he writes, however, with great eloquence, and is an enthusiast in mathematical, chemical, and mineralogical pursuits' (13 December 1808). The original portrait by Benjamin W. Crosbie was probably made for his Modern Athenians (1831), a collection of caricature etchings of prominent Edinburgh citizens.</description>

		<description>Engraved half-length portrait of Major-General David Stewart (1772-1829) in military uniform. David Stewart of Garth worked with Sir Walter Scott on the committee which organized the visit of King George IV to Edinburgh in August 1822. A hero of the Napoleonic Wars, Stewart is now best-known as the author of Sketches of the Character, Manners and Present State of the Highlanders of Scotland (1822). In 1828 he was appointed Governor of St Lucia. In a letter to J. G. Lockhart of 14 July 1828, Scott expresses his pleasure in the appointment, praising Stewart as a 'highlander of the old stamp'.</description>

		<creator>Geddes, Andrew (b.1783, d.1844)</creator>
		<description>Engraved half-length portrait of Scottish painter Sir David Wilkie (1785-1841). Sir David Wilkie painted Scott on three occasions: in the group compositions 'The Abbotsford Family' (1817) and 'The Entrance of King George IV at Holyrood' (1829) and in an individual portrait (1824). He also left a sketch of 'Sir Walter Scott Coursing' (1817 or 1824). Besides painting a number of pictures inspired by the Waverley Novels, Wilkie contributed illustrations to the Magnum Opus edition of the Waverley Novels. Scott was a great admirer of Wilkie's work. In chapter 10 of The Antiquary (1816), he describes Steenie Mucklebackit's mourning family as presenting 'a scene which our Wilkie alone could have painted, with that exquisite feeling of nature that characterises his enchanting productions'. The original portrait of Wilkie by Andrew Geddes was painted in 1821.</description>

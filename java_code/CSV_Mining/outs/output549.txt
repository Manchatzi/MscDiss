The Editor of the Quarterly Facsimile reproduction of a print portrait of J.G. Lockhart by Daniel Maclise Sketch of Sir Walter Scott's son-in-law and biographer, J.G. Lockhart. The writer and editor John Gibson Lockhart was Scott's son-in-law and biographer. He married Scott's daughter Sophia in 1820 and in 1837-38 published the monumental Memoirs of the Life of Sir Walter Scott, Bart., regarded by many as the greatest Romantic biography and still a standard reference work for scholars of Scott. Lockhart edited the influential Tory periodical, the Quarterly Review, from 1826 to 1853. This is a facsimile reproduction, on a slightly reduced scale, of one of a series of portraits originally published in Fraser's Magazine, 1830-38, under the title 'A Gallery of Illustrious Literary Characters'.

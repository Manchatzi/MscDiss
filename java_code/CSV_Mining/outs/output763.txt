Author of 'Sayings and Doings' Facsimile reproduction of a print portrait of Theodore Hook by Daniel Maclise Sketch of English author Theodore Hook (1788-1841), with facsimile of signature. Walter Scott expressed admiration for Theodore Hook's 'Sayings and Doings' and offered support during Hook's imprisonment as a state debtor. It was largely through Scott's offices that Hook was appointed editor of the Tory newspaper John Bull in 1820. However, Scott also warned J. G. Lockhart that too much social contact with such a 'raffish' fellow could damage Lockhart's reputation (Letters of 15 October and November 1825). This facsimile reproduction is of one of a series of portraits originally published in Fraser's Magazine, 1830-38, under the title of 'A Gallery of Illustrious Literary Characters'. Maclise, D. The Maclise Portrait Gallery of Illustrious Literary Characters, ed. W. Bates. London: Chatto and Windus, 1883 (facing p. 126)

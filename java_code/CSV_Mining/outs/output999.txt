Melrose Abbey: From the Quarry Engraving of Melrose Abbey by R. Brandard after C. Stanfield Depicts the town of Melrose, Scottish Borders, and the ruins of Melrose Abbey with a quarry in the foreground. Sir Walter Scott coordinated the restoration of Melrose Abbey in 1822. The Abbey features in many of Scott's works, most famously The Lay of the Last Minstrel (1805): 'If thou would'st view fair Melrose aright, | Go visit it by the pale moonlight [...] | Then view St. David's ruin'd pile; | And, home returning, soothly swear, | Was never scene so sad and fair!' (canto II, stanza I, lines 1-2, 16-18). The religious house of Kennaquhair in The Monastery and The Abbot (both 1820) is also based on the Abbey, and it is described in detail in Scott's 'Essay on Border Antiquities' (1814). The original steel engraving was made for the Abbotsford Edition of the Waverley Novels (1842-1847). Scott, W. The Monastery. Edinburgh: Adam and Charles Black, [185-?]   Melrose Abbey

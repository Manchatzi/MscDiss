Robert Burns Steel engraved portrait of Burns by H. Robinson after a picture by A. Naysmith Engraved portrait of the Scottish poet Robert Burns (1759-1796). For Sir Walter Scott, Robert Burns and Lord Byron were 'the most genuine poetical geniuses of my time, and half a century before me' (Journal, 9 February 1826). When asked by James Ballantyne how he ranked his own genius next to Burns, Scott replied: 'There is no comparison whatever -- we ought not to be named in the same day.' Scott met Burns only once at the age of fifteen in 1787 at Sciennes Hill House, Edinburgh, an event he frequently recalled. Besides copious quotations from Burns in his published works and letters, Scott included ballads collected by Burns in his Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border (1802-1803). He provided his son-in-law J. G. Lockhart with letters and reminiscences for his Life of Burns (1828) and approved of Lockhart's decision to gloss over the poet's perceived moral failings. Scott also helped organize a subscription for a monument to Burns in Dumfries (1814) and personally subscribed to the Burns Monument on Calton Hill, Edinburgh (1817). The original portrait of Burns was painted in 1787. Wilson, J. G. The Poets and Poetry of Scotland. London: Blackie & Son., 1876-1877

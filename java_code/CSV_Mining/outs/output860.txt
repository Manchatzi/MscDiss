Glammis Castle, Forfarshire Lithograph of Glamis Castle by T. Picken after G. Cattermole Depicts Glamis Castle, Angus. Scott visited Glamis (or Glammis) Castle, seat of the Earl of Strathmore in 1793. In his Letters on Demonology and Witchcraft (1830), he recalls experiencing 'that degree of superstitious awe that my countrymen call eerie' when spending the night at the notoriously haunted castle. He wrote: 'I must own, that as I heard door after door shut, after my conductor had retired, I began to consider myself too far from the living and somewhat too near the dead' (Letter X). Glenallan House in Scott's novel, The Antiquary (1816), is said to be based on Glamis Castle. Lawson, J.P. Scotland Delineated: In a Series of Views by Clarkson Stanfield. London: J.

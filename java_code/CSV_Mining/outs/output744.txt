On 16 December 1799 Sir Walter Scott was appointed Sheriff Depute of Selkirkshire, a post which he held until his death in 1832. The post required Scott to reside in the county for part of the year, in order to perform his duties at Selkirk Sheriff Court. Initially Scott stayed at Clovenfords Inn, near Galashiels, but eventually in 1804 leased the property of Ashestiel.

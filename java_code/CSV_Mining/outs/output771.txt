The Editor of the Literary Gazette Facsimile reproduction of a print portrait of William Jerdan by Daniel Maclise Sketch of Scottish journalist William Jerdan (1782-1869), with facsimile of signature. A native of Kelso, William Jerdan was the founder and editor of the Literary Gazette. His father John Jerdan was an early acquaintance of Scott and a schoolfriend of his father and uncle. In his Autobiography (London: A. Hall, Virtue, 1852-1853), Jerdan regrets having offended Scott by his strictures on some of his works. However, in the later years of Scott's life, Jerdan adds, he was 'on most friendly terms' with Scott and 'among the foremost of his acquaintances' when he visited London (vol. IV, pp. 344-45). Jerdan also included a biographical sketch of Scott in his Men I Have Known (1866). Scott's correspondence reveals irritation at Jerdan's habit of inserting premature or erroneous announcements of new publications by Scott. This facsimile reproduction is of one of a series of portraits originally published in Fraser's Magazine, 1830-1838, under the title of 'A Gallery of Illustrious Literary Characters'. Maclise, D. The Maclise Portrait Gallery of Illustrious Literary Characters, ed. W. Bates. London: Chatto and Windus, 1883 (facing p. 8)

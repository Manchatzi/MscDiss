Dryburgh Abbey Lithograph of St. Mary's Aisle, Dryburgh Abbey by T. Picken after J. Dobbin Depicts a man and a woman visiting Scott's Sir Walter Scott's tomb in St. Mary's Aisle, Dryburgh Abbey, Scottish Borders. Sir Walter Scott was interred in St. Mary's Aisle on September 26, 1832. Scott lamented in his 'Autobiography' (1808) that, though his ancestors, the Haliburtons, once owned the Abbey, 'we have nothing left of Dryburgh... but the right of stretching our bones.' Scott's wife, Margaret Charlotte Carpenter, his eldest son, Walter Scott, and his son-in-law and biographer, J.G. Lockhart, are also buried here. Lawson, J.P.

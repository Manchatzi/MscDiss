High Street, Edinburgh Steel engraving by W. Radclyffe after a painting by T. Stothard relating to Scott's novel The Abbot Depicts the High Street in Edinburgh as it was in the sixteenth century (as seen by Roland Graeme in The Abbot, ch. 17). There are several anachronisms in this engraving, notably the presence of the 17th-century Tron Kirk and the absence of the Netherbow Gate which divided the High Street from the Canongate.

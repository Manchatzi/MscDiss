Loch Oich & Invergarry Castle (Inverness-shire): Looking West Engraving of Loch Oich by J. Swan after J. Fleming Depicts Loch Oich, Scottish Highlands, with Invergarry Castle on the far shore. Invergarry Castle was the seat of the MacDonells of Glengarry until it was burned down in 1746 following the battle of Culloden. The fugitive Prince Charles Edward Stuart is reputed to have taken refuge in the castle, an episode which Scott relates in Tales of a Grandfather, Third Series (1830). In The Heart of Mid-Lothian (1818), the Jacobite Captain of Knockdunder recalls being garrisoned in the Castle during the '45. Leighton, J.M. The Lakes of Scotland: A Series of Views. Glasgow: J.

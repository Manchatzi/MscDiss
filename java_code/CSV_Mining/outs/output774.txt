John Knox: From a Picture in the Possession of Lord Somerville Engraved portrait of John Knox by B. Holl after an unknown artist Engraved portrait of an unidentified 17th-century Scottish divine, once thought to be John Knox (ca. 1514-1572). Scott never portrayed John Knox directly in his fiction, but his 1820 novels The Monastery and The Abbot portray the triumph of the Knox-inspired Reformation in Scotland. Scott's preacher Henry Warden is presented as second only in power and eloquence to Knox. In The Abbot even the Catholic Mary Queen of Scots salutes Knox's power, describing him as 'the ablest and most powerful of heresiarchs' (ch. 25). Scott also described Knox's role in the Reformation in the historical Tales of a Grandfather, First Series (1828), where Knox is introduced as 'a man of great corage, zeal, and talents' and as the 'bold and inflexible father of the Scottish Reformation'. For each of these works, Knox's own Historie of the Reformation of the Church of Scotland was an important source. The Somerville portrait, whose authenticity was asserted by Thomas Carlyle, is no longer thought to be an image of Knox. The Portrait Gallery of Distinguished Poets. Vol. I. London: Wm. S.

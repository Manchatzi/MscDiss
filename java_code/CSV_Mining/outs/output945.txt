Glasgow (St. Mungo's) Cathedral: Interior Lithograph of a scene inside Glasgow Cathedral by T. Picken after J. Nash Depicts a confrontation inside Glasgow Cathedral at the time of the Reformation. Glasgow Cathedral is the scene of an important meeting between Frank Osbaldistone and Rob Roy in ch. 19 of Sir Walter Scott's novel Rob Roy (1817). Osbaldistone, the narrator, describes his first impression of the building in ch. 18: 'The pile is of a gloomy and massive, rather than of an elegant, style of Gothic architecture; but its peculiar character is so strongly preserved, and so well suited with the accompaniments that surround it, that the impression of the first view was awful and solemn in the extreme.' This engraving possibly depicts the (successful) efforts of the tradesmen of Glasgow to prevent the Cathedral from being demolished at the Reformation. This episode is recalled in Scott's novel by Osbaldistone's man-servant Andrew Fairservice. Lawson, J.P. Scotland Delineated: In a Series of Views by Clarkson Stanfield. London: J.

Mysie Happer Steel engraving by G. H. Adcock from a drawing by E. Prentis of a character from Scott's novel The Monastery Three quarter portrait of Mysie Happer, the miller's daughter in Scott's novel The Monastery. Inspired by the lines: 'The countenance itself was exceedingly comely--the eyes black, large, and roguishly good-humoured--the mouth was small--the lips well formed, though somewhat full--the teeth were pearly white--and the chin had a very seducing dimple in it.' (The Monastery, ch. 13) Portraits of the Principal Female Characters in the Waverley Novels: With Illustrative Letter-Press. London: Chapman & Hall, 1833-

Melrose and the Abbey Facsimile of a watercolour painting of Melrose by S. Palmer Depicts the countryside of Melrose, Scottish Borders, with the Abbey in the background. Sir Walter Scott's home of Abbotsford lay only a few miles west of the town of Melrose in the Scottish Borders. Melrose is set in the heart of the 'Scott Country', and is featured in many of his works, most notably The Lay of the Last Minstrel (1805) and, under the guise of 'Kennaquhair', in The Monastery and The Abbot (both 1820). Town and abbey are described in detail in Scott's 'Essay on Border Antiquities' (1814). Smith, W., et al. Scott Country: Water-Colours. London: A. & C. Black, 1932 (plate 4)   Melrose

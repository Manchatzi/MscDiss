[Etched portrait of Walter Scott by William Nicholson]  Engraved portrait of Walter Scott aged forty-six, with his dog Maida. William Nicholson made at least three watercolour portraits of Sir Walter Scott in 1816. One formed the basis for this etching executed in 1817 by Nicholson himself. The only significant difference between the watercolour and the etching is that Scott's dog Maida has been moved somewhat to the right, leaving more of Scott's waistcoat visible. Nicholson, W.

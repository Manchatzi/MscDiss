John Knox Engraved title page and frontispiece of Scott's The Abbot Title page of The Abbot, volume XX of a set of the Waverley Novels published by A. & C. Black, depicting John Knox (ca. 1514-1572). Scott never portrayed John Knox directly in his fiction, but his 1820 novels The Monastery and The Abbot portray the triumph of the Knox-inspired Reformation in Scotland. Scott's preacher Henry Warden is presented as second only in power and eloquence to Knox. In The Abbot even the Catholic Mary Queen of Scots salutes Knox's power, describing him as 'the ablest and most powerful of heresiarchs' (ch. 25). Scott also described Knox's role in the Reformation in the historical Tales of a Grandfather, First Series (1828), where Knox is introduced as 'a man of great courage, zeal, and talents' and as the 'bold and inflexible father of the Scottish Reformation'. For each of these works, Knox's own Historie of the Reformation of the Church of Scotland was an important source. The original wood engraving was made for the Abbotsford edition of the Waverley Novels (1842-1847), where it was used to illustrate The Monastery. It was engraved by John Orrin Smith and William James Linton after a drawing by William Dickes. Dickes's drawing was based on one of several earlier prints all ultimately deriving from a portrait by Adrian Van Son (ca. 1580). Scott, W. The Abbot.

[Facsimile of a painting of Smailholm Tower by Thomas Scott]  Depicts Smailholm Tower (Scottish Borders) atop Sandyknowe Crag with a horse and rider in the foreground. Smailholm Tower, near Kelso, is a fifteenth-century peel tower which was the home of Sir Walter Scott's ancestors the Scotts of Harden. The tower is situated on Sandyknowe Crag, above Sandyknowe Farm where Walter Scott spent much of his early childhood at the home of his paternal grandparents: 'Then rise those crags, that mountain tower, | Which charm'd my fancy's wakening hour.' (Marmion, Introduction to Canto Third, lines 158-59). Besides celebrating Smailholm Tower in Marmion, Scott set his ballad 'The Eve of St John' (1799) there and is thought to have modelled Avenel Castle in The Monastery and the Abbot (both 1820) on the tower.

[Engraving of Fast Castle by J. Horsburgh after J. Thomson]  Depicts the ruins of Fast Castle on a promontory and a stretch of Berwickshire coastline. Fast Castle, near St Abbs Head, Berwickshire, has been identified as an inspiration for Wolf's Crag, the home of the Master of Ravenswood in Sir Walter Scott's The Bride of Lammermoor (1819). In the Magnum Opus edition of the novel (1830), Scott claims that he cannot comment on the perceived resemblance between Wolf's Crag and Fast Castle as he has only seen the latter from the sea. He acknowledges, however, that the position of Fast Castle resembles that of Wolf's Crag. Scott owned a painting of Fast Castle by the Rev. John Thomson (Letters, VIII, 459), quite possibly the one engraved here. The original steel engraving was made for the Abbotsford Edition of the Waverley Novels (1842-1847). Scott, W. The Bride of Lammermoor. Edinburgh: Adam and Charles Black, [185-?]   Fast Castle

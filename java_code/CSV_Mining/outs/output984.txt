Tower Erected to William Tell Engraved title page and frontispiece of Scott's Anne of Geierstein Title page of Anne of Geierstein, volume XLV of a set of the Waverley Novels published by A. & C. Black, depicting a monument to William Tell. The legend of William Tell is constantly invoked throughout Sir Walter Scott's Anne of Geierstein (1829). The caption to this engraving is a little misleading. The monument to Tell is not the tower but the statue overlooking the fountain. It was created in 1786 by Benedikt Curiger and removed in 1859 to make way for a new monument. The original wood engraving was made for the Abbotsford edition of the Waverley Novels (1842-1847).

Sir J. Banks: From a Picture by T. Phillips in the Possession of the Royal Society Steel engraving of Sir Joseph Banks by C. E. Wagstaff after a painting by T. Phillips Engraved portrait of the naturalist and explorer Sir Joseph Banks (1743-1820). In a letter dated 10 February 1816, Scott asked Anna Jane Clephane to send him a humorous ballad that she had written about the Duke of Argyll's Factor. The Factor had reputedly sent the skeleton of a porpoise to Banks in the belief that it was a mermaid. When Banks attempted to disabuse him, the Factor opined that the distinguished naturalist was an 'auld blind doited deevil'. Scott relates a similar anecdote in a note to the Magnum Opus Edition of The Pirate (1831) recalling how a supposed sea-serpent was washed up on the shore of Shetland and sent to Banks for examination. Banks proclaimed it 'a basking shark', yet, Scott adds, 'it would seem that an animal so well known ought to have been immediately distinguished by the northern fishermen'. The original portrait by Thomas Phillips was painted in 1810. The Portrait Gallery of Distinguished Poets, vol. III. London: Wm. S. Orr & Co., 1853

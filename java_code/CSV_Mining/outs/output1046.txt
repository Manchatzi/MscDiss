Alice Bridgnorth Engraved portrait by H.T. Ryall after W. Mulready of the heroine of Scott's novel Peveril of the Peak Engraved half-length portrait of Alice Bridgenorth, heroine of Sir Walter Scott's novel Peveril of the Peak (1823). This portrait of Alice Bridgenorth was inspired by the following lines in ch. 13 of the novel: 'The sad-coloured gown--the pinched and plaited cap, which carefully obscured the profusion of long dark-brown hair--the small ruff, and the long sleeves, would have appeared to great disadvantage on a shape less graceful than Alice Bridgenorth's.'

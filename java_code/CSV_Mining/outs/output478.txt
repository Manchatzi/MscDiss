Cowper: From a Picture in the Possession of the Publisher Steel engraved portrait of William Cowper by W. Holl Engraved portrait of the English poet William Cowper (1731-1800). In both his published works and private correspondence, Sir Walter Scott frequently quoted Cowper's poetry, particularly 'The Task' which is cited in both The Heart of Mid-Lothian (1818, ch. 1) and Saint Ronan's Well (1823, ch. 15). According to Basil Hall's Fragments of Voyages and Travels (1834), when sailing from Portsmouth Harbour in 1831, Scott asked to be shown the spot where the HMS Royal George was accidentally sunk. Scott then quoted the following lines from Cowper's 'Loss of the Royal George': 'His sword was in its sheath | His fingers held the pen, | Where Kempenfield went down | With twice four hundred men.' The engraving is derived from a portrait by Lemuel Francis Abbott (1792) probably via an earlier engraving by Henry Hoppner Meyer (1816). The Portrait Gallery of Distinguished Poets, vol. III.

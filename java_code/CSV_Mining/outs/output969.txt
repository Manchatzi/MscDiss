George Villiers, Duke of Buckingham Engraved title page and frontispiece of Scott's The Fortunes of Nigel Title page of The Fortunes of Nigel, volume XXVII of a set of the Waverley Novels published by A. & C. Black, depicting the George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham (1592-1628). Buckingham appears as the omnipotent favourite of both King James VI and I and the Prince of Wales in Sir Walter Scott's The Fortunes of Nigel (1822). Scott describes him as 'more feared than beloved, and, if not absolutely of a tyrannical disposition [...] accounted haughty, violent, and vindictive' (ch. 6). The original wood engraving was made for the Abbotsford Edition of the Waverley Novels (1842-1847). It derives, via earlier engravings, from a portrait by Michiel Jansz van Miereveld (1567-1641).

N. Transept of Melrose Abbey Engraving of the ruins of Melrose Abbey by J.T. Bower Depicts the ruins of the North Transept of Melrose Abbey, Scottish Borders. Sir Walter Scott coordinated the restoration of Melrose Abbey in 1822. The Abbey features in many of Scott's works, most famously The Lay of the Last Minstrel (1805): 'If thou would'st view fair Melrose aright, | Go visit it by the pale moonlight [...] | Then view St. David's ruin'd pile; | And, home returning, soothly swear, | Was never scene so sad and fair!' (canto II, stanza I, lines 1-2, 16-18). The religious house of Kennaquhair in The Monastery and The Abbot (both 1820) is based on the Abbey, and it is described in detail in Scott's 'Essay on Border Antiquities' (1814). The print was engraved by John Bower after his own design. The History and Antiquities of Melrose, Old Melrose, and Dryburgh Abbeys. Melrose: J. Bower, 1852 (facing p. 41)   Melrose Abbey

[Steel engraving by E. Radclyffe after a drawing by W. L. Windus of a scene from Scott's story The Surgeon's Daughter]  Depicts Richard Middlemas pleading with his father, and his mother Zilia fainting (Surgeon's Daughter, ch. 9). Illustrates the text: 'Richard Middlemas sunk on one knee [...]. "O, my more than father," he said, "how much greater a debt do I owe to you than to the unnatural parents, who [...] deserted me through their cruelty!" Zilia, as she heard these cutting words, flung back her veil, raising it on both hands till it floated behind her like a mist, and then giving a faint groan, sunk down in a swoon.' Scott, W. Waverley Novels. Library Edition, vol. 17, Edinburgh: Adam & Charles Black, 1877

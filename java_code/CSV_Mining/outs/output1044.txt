Edith Plantagenet Engraved portrait by G. Parker after S.A. Hart of the heroine of Scott's novel The Talisman Depicts Edith Plantagenet, heroine of Sir Walter Scott's novel The Talisman (1825), dressed as a Carmelite votaress with a chaplet of red and white roses. This portrait of Edith Plantagenet was inspired by a passage in ch. 4 of The Talisman in which Edith appears as a Carmelite novice: 'Six, who from their black scapularies, and black veils over their white garments, appeared to be professed nuns of the order of Mount Carmel; and as many whose veils, being white, argued them to be novices, or occasional inhabitants in the cloister, who were not as yet bound to it by vows. The former held in their hands large rosaries, while the younger and lighter figures who followed carried each a chaplet of red and white roses... one of the white-stoled maidens, as she glided by him, detached from the chaplet which she carried a rosebud, which dropped from her fingers, perhaps unconsciously, on the foot of Sir Kenneth.'

[Facsimile of a painting of St. Mary's Loch by Thomas Scott]  Depicts St. Mary's Loch, Scottish Borders, and surrounding countryside. Sir Walter Scott most famously describes St. Mary's Loch in Marmion (1808): 'Oft in my mind such thoughts awake, | By lone Saint Mary's silent lake; | Thou know'st it well,---nor fen, nor sedge, | Pollute the pure lake's crystal edge; | Abrupt and sheer, the mountains sink | At once upon the level brink; | And just a trace of silver sand | Marks where the water meets the land' (Introduction to Canto Second, lines 146-153). Scott made many excursions to the loch, situated near Moffat in the Scottish Borders. The surrounding landscape (Moffatdale) is featured in Old Mortality (1816). Crockett, W.S. Footsteps of Scott.

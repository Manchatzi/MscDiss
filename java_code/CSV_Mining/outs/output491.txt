Dryden: From a Picture by Hudson in the Hall of Trinity College Cambridge Steel engraved portrait of Dryden by C. E. Wagstaff after a painting by T. Hudson Engraved portrait of the English poet John Dryden (1631-1700). In 1808, Scott published the first complete and uniform edition of Dryden's works which is still regarded as one of the best-edited projects in English. Scott immersed himself in the literary and controversial writings of Dryden's age, and his edition provides a vivid picture of Restoration England. It is prefaced by a 'Life of Dryden' in which Scott praises the poet for the 'power of ratiocination, of investigating, discovering, and appreciating that which is really excellent [...] accompanied with the necessary command of fanciful illustration and elegant expression'. Scott placed Dryden behind only Shakespeare and Milton, but argued that he excelled both in versatility and had 'no equal' as a lyric poet. No other writer is quoted as frequently as Dryden in Scott's published works. Dryden's dramas also influenced Scott's own portrayal of seventeenth-century England, particularly Absalom and Achitopel, which informs the portrayal of Charles II and his favourite Buckingham in Peveril of the Peak (1823).

John Flaxman: From the Original Picture by John Jackson in the Possession of the Right Hon. Lord Dover Steel engraved portrait of John Flaxman by R. Woodman after a painting by John Jackson Engraved portrait of the English sculptor and designer John Flaxman (1755-1826). Sir Walter Scott's friend George Ellis suggested that he invite Flaxman to illustrate The Lay of the Last Minstrel (1805). Scott feared, however, that Flaxman's style was 'too classical to stoop to body forth my Gothic Borderers' and that there would be 'some risk of their resembling the antique of Homer's heroes, rather than the iron race of Salvator' (letter of 21 August 1804). Scott had, in fact, already arranged to have the volume illustrated by engravings from paintings by John James Masquerier. Flaxman himself was no admirer of Scott. According to Crabb Robinson's diary, he remarked to Samuel Rogers that 'his works have in no respect tended to improve the moral condition of mankind'. The original portrait by John Jackson was painted in the mid-1820s. The Portrait Gallery of Distinguished Poets, vol. III. London: Wm. S. Orr & Co., 1853

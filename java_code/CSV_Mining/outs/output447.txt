Bolivar: From an Engraving by M. N. Bate Steel engraved portrait of Bolivar by W. Holl after a print by M. N. Bate Engraved portrait of the Latin American soldier and statesman Simon Bolivar (1783-1830), called El Liberador. The original portrait was probably that painted by JosÌ© Gil de Castro in 1825. (It is unclear why the Corson Collection of Walter Scott materials contains a portrait of Bolivar, perhaps because there are statues of both Scott and Bolivar in New York's Central Park?) The Portrait Gallery of Distinguished Poets, vol. III. London: Wm. S. Orr & Co., 1853

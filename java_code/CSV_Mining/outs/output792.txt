Author of 'Hajji Baba in England' Facsimile reproduction of a print portrait of James Justinian Morier by Daniel Maclise Facsimile of a sketch of British diplomat and novelist James Justinian Morier (1780?-1849), with facsimile of signature. Walter Scott submitted a favourable review of Morier's comic novel The Adventures of Hajji Baba of Ispahan in England for the Quarterly Review of January 1829. In the introduction to the 'Magnum Opus' edition of The Talisman, Scott praised Morier for describing 'the manners and vices of the Eastern nations, not only with fidelity, but with the humour of Le Sage and the ludicrous power of Fielding himself'. This facsimile reproduction is of one of a series of portraits originally published in Fraser's Magazine, 1830-1838, under the title 'A Gallery of Illustrious Literary Characters'. Maclise, D. The Maclise Portrait Gallery of Illustrious Literary Characters, ed. W. Bates. London: Chatto and Windus, 1883 (facing p.90)

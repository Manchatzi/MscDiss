Hermitage Castle, Liddesdale Facsimile of a pencil drawing of Hermitage Castle by G. Home Depicts Hermitage Castle, Scottish Borders, and surrounding countryside. The sixteenth-century castle of Hermitage was a favourite of Scott's and is described in his 'Essay on Border Antiquities' (1814). While gathering ballads in Liddesdale Scott carried out excavations at the Hermitage and made a sketch of the castle. A print derived from Scott's sketch was published in Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border (1802-04), and the backdrop of Sir Henry Raeburn's 1808 portrait of Scott is also based on it. Baikie, J.

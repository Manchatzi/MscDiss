Crown of Thomas a Becket at Canterbury Engraved title page and frontispiece of Scott's Ivanhoe Title page of Ivanhoe, volume XVII of a set of the Waverley Novels published by A. & C. Black, depicting the Corona of Canterbury Cathedral, Kent. This image depicts the 'Corona' or the east end of Canterbury Cathedral, named after the severed crown of St Thomas Becket (St. Thomas the Martyr), who was assassinated in the cathedral in 1170. The Corona was built to contain a shrine to St Thomas, which was subsequently destroyed on the orders of Henry VIII in 1540. St Thomas' name is used in many oaths in Walter Scott's Ivanhoe (1819). Prince John also despairs about the loyalty of his men: "An unhappy prince am I. My father, King Henry, had faithful servants---He had but to say that he was plagued with a factious priest, and the blood of Thomas-a-Becket, saint though he was, stained the steps of his own altar" (ch. 11). The original wood engraving was made for the Abbotsford Edition of the Waverley Novels (1842-1847). The engraving by Jewitt is presumably after his own design. Scott, W. Ivanhoe. Edinburgh: Adam and Charles Black, [185-?]   Canterbury Cathedral

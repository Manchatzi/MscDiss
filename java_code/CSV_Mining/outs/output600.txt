Sir Walter Scott's Tomb, Dryburgh Abbey Engraving of St Mary's Aisle, Dryburgh Abbey by W. Banks and Son Depicts visitors at St Mary's Aisle, Dryburgh Abbey, Scottish Borders, the burial place of Sir Walter Scott. Sir Walter Scott was interred in St. Mary's Aisle on September 26, 1832. Scott lamented in his 'Autobiography' that, though his ancestors, the Haliburtons, once owned the Abbey, 'we have nothing left of Dryburgh... but the right of stretching our bones.' Scott's wife, Margaret Charlotte Carpenter, his eldest son, Walter Scott, and his son-in-law and biographer, J.G. Lockhart, are also buried here. The engraving may have been based on an original drawing by William Banks or his son. William Banks and Co. (or William Banks and Son) were active between 1858 and 1890.    Dryburgh Abbey

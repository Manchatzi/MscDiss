Coke: From a Picture in the Hall of Sergeant's Inn, Chancery Lane Steel engraved portrait of Sir Edward Coke by J. Posselwhite Engraved portrait of the English judge and writer on law Sir Edward Coke (1552-1634). One of the most important jurists in English history, Coke is best-known for his Institutes of the Laws of England (1628-44). In chapter 8 of Sir Walter Scott's Rob Roy (1818), Justice Inglewood is reconciled to his office when his clerk, Joseph Jobson, reminds him of Coke's assertion that 'the whole Christian world hath not the like of it, so it be duly executed'. Scott also discusses Coke's unhappy marriage to Lady Elizabeth Hatton and their dispute over their daughter's marriage in a footnote to his edition of Secret History of the Court of James the First (1811). The engraving by Posselwhite is from an original portrait by Cornelius Janssen van Ceulen (1593-1661). The Portrait Gallery of Distinguished Poets, vol. I. London: Wm. S. Orr & Co., 1853

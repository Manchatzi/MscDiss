Ben Jonson. From a Picture in the Possession of Mr. Knight Engraved portrait of Ben Jonson by E. Scriven after A. Blyenberch Engraved portrait of English poet and playwright, Ben Jonson (1573?-1637). Walter Scott drew liberally on Ben Jonson's comedies when depicting 17th-century London life in his novel The Fortunes of Nigel (1822). Scott considered Jonson 'one of our our neglected classics' and urged the Rev. Edward Forster to prepare a 'handsome and complete' edition of his dramas (letter of 27 October 1805). Scott frequently quoted from Jonson in his published works and correspondence, particularly favouring Every Man in His Humour. The original portrait by Abraham van Blyenberch was painted ca. 1617.

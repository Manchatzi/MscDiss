[Steel engraving by E. Radclyffe after a drawing by A. Soloman of a scene from Scott's novel Saint Ronan's Well]  Shows Francis Tyrrel saving Clara Mowbray from the attentions of a drunken countryman (St. Ronan's Well, ch. 25). Illustrates the text: 'They had accomplished their purpose greatly to their satisfaction, and were hying home after sunset, when they were encountered by a country fellow [...] who [...] saw not the nobility of blood through her disguise, and accosted the daughter of a hundred sires as he would have done a ewe-milker. Miss Mowbray remonstrated--her companion screamed--up came cousin Francis with a fowling-piece on his shoulder, and soon put the sylvan to flight.' Scott, W. Waverley Novels. Library Edition, vol. 17, Edinburgh: Adam & Charles Black, 1877

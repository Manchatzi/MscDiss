Bramante: From a Picture by Alessandro D'Este in the Collection of the Capitol, at Rome Steel engraved portrait of Bramante by J. Posselwhite from a picture by Alessandro D'Este Engraved portrait of the Italian architect and painter Donato Bramante (1444-1514). Bramante is best known as the architect of St Peter's Basilica in Rome. Scott visited St Peter's in April 1832 while travelling on the Continent in an unsuccessful attempt to repair his health. His main interest lay, however, not in Bramante's architecture but in Canova's Cenotaph of the Stuarts erected in St Peter's with financial backing from King George IV. The 19th-century portrait by Alessandro D'Este is based on an unidentified earlier image. The Portrait Gallery of Distinguished Poets, vol. I. London: Wm. S.

Headland of Culswick, Pictish Fort: Norna's Dwelling Engraved title page and frontispiece of Scott's The Pirate Title page of The Pirate, volume XXV of a set of the Waverley Novels published by A. & C. Black, depicting Fitful Head, Shetland. In Sir Walter Scott's The Pirate (1821), the self-style prophetess Ulla Troil inhabits a pictish fort or broch on Fitful Head, Shetland. No such structure exists on Fitful Head, and Scott is generally thought to have modelled her imaginary dwelling on the nearby brochs of Mousa and Culswick (the latter portrayed here). Scott visited Shetland in 1814 when he joined a party of Commissioners for the Northern Lighthouse Service on a voyage of inspection around the coast of Scotland. The original wood engraving was made for the Abbotsford Edition of the Waverley Novels (1842-1847). Scott, W. The Pirate. Edinburgh: Adam and Charles Black, [185-?] Culswick Shetland

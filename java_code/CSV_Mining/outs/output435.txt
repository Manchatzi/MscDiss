Mr. Allan Self-portrait of Sir William Allan steel-engraved by W.H. Lizars Engraved self-portrait of the Scottish painter Sir William Allan in Circassian costume. Sir Walter Scott was a friend and patron of Allan and a constant advocate of his work. They first met in 1816, and Scott subsequently invited Allan to Abbotsford in 1818 to help arrange the armoury. When Charles Montagu-Scott, 4th Duke of Buccleuch, asked for a portrait of Scott, he recommended Allan, describing him as a 'man of real genius' who had made 'one or two glorious portraits' (letter of 15 April 1819). The Duke opted for Raeburn, but Allan went on to paint a number of portraits of Scott and of his family, notably one of Scott's son, Walter, in his full Hussar uniform (1821). Besides a number of historical paintings inspired by Scott's works, Allan was responsible for Illustrations of the Novels and Tales of the Author of Waverley (Edinburgh: Archibald Constable, 1820). Allan's friendship with Scott lasted until the writer's dying day when Allan was the only non-family member present at Abbotsford. The original self-portrait of Allan in Circassian costume was painted in 1813. It was engraved by Lizars for J. G. Lockhart's Peters Letters to his Kinsfolk (1819). Lockhart, J. G.

Jedburgh Abbey Lithograph of Jedburgh Abbey by T. Picken Depicts Jedburgh Abbey, Scottish Borders, with cattle grazing by the Jed River in the foreground. Sir Walter Scott describes Jedburgh Abbey in his 'Essay on Border Antiquities' (1814), inaccurately praising its Anglo-Norman chapter-house as 'a very perfect specimen of Saxon architecture'. There are further references in The Black Dwarf and The Monastery. The Abbey was built by David I around 1138 but had fallen into ruin by the mid-sixteenth century. Scott was a frequent visitor to Jedburgh in his capacity as Sheriff Depute of Selkirkshire. He subscribed å£10 toward the repair-work on the Abbey's tower in 1824-1826. The lithograph by Thomas Picken is from his own design. Lawson, J.P. Scotland Delineated: In a Series of Views by Clarkson Stanfield. London: J. Hogarth, 1847-1854   Jedburgh Abbey

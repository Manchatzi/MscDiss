The University Engraving of Old College, Edinburgh University by an unattributed artist Depicts the Old College, University of Edinburgh. The foundation stone of the building now known as Old College was laid in 1789, but construction work was hindered by the Napoleonic Wars, and only a small part of Robert Adam's original design was built. The building was completed between 1817 and 1840 following an amended design by William Playfair. A dome by Robert Rowand Anderson was added in 1877. Scott attended the University of Edinburgh between 1783 and 1786 and between 1789 and 1792. The Old College faces College Wynd, Scott's birthplace. Black's Picturesque Tourist of Scotland.

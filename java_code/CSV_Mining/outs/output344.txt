[Oil painting of Melrose Abbey after D. Roberts]  Depicts the ruins of Melrose Abbey, Scottish Borders. The description of a moonlit Melrose Abbey in Scott's Lay of the Last Minstrel (canto II, stanza 1), and its further depiction in The Monastery and The Abbot (both 1820), led to it becoming a popular destination for sightseers. The original painting by Roberts was exhibited at the Society of British Artists in 1824. Cf. Guiterman, H. and Llewellyn, B. (eds). David Roberts (Oxford: Phaidon Press, 1986).    Melrose Abbey

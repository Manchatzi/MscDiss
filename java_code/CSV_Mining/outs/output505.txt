His Majesty King George the IV: Born August 12 1762 Steel engraved portrait of George IV Engraved vignette portrait of George IV, King of Great Britain (1762-1830) with geometrical surround design. George IV, both as Prince Regent and King, bestowed a number of favours upon Sir Walter Scott. In 1813 he offered Scott the post of Poet Laureate (which Scott refused in favour of Robert Southey). In 1815 he twice invited Scott to dine with him and granted him free access to the Regent's Library, where Scott consulted papers on the Jacobite Rebellions of 1715 and 1745-46. In 1818 Scott became the first man to be knighted under George IV and the first ever to be knighted in recognition of literary merit. When the new king commissioned Sir Thomas Lawrence to paint the most distinguished men of the age for the great gallery at Windsor Castle, he desired that Scott be foremost amongst the men of science and letters. For his part, Scott played a leading role in organizing the visit of King George IV to Edinburgh in 1822, the first visit of a Hanoverian monarch to Scotland. The 'Magnum Opus' edition of the Waverley Novels is dedicated to the King. The uncredited engraving is based on a painting by Thomas Phillips and closely resembles an engraving by Luigi Schiavonetti in the National Portrait Gallery.

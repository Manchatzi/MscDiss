Neil Gow the Violinist Engraved title page and frontispiece of Scott's St Ronan's Well Title page of Saint Ronan's Well, volume XXXIV of a set of the Waverley Novels published by A. & C. Black, featuring Niel Gow (1727-1807). Niel (or Neil) Gow was the most celebrated Scottish fiddler of the 18th century. His son Nathaniel (1766-1831), a first-rate musician and composer in his own right, plays during the theatricals at Shaws-Castle in Sir Walter Scott's St Ronan's Well (1823). Touchwood comments: 'He is his father's own son [...]. It is many a long year since I listened to old Neil at Inver, and, to say truth, spent a night with him over pancakes and Athole brose; and I never expected to hear his match again in my lifetime' (ch. 20). The original wood engraving, probably by John Andrew, was made for the Abbotsford Edition of the Waverley Novels (1842-1847). Scott, W. Saint Ronan's Well.

Lord Chatham: From a Print by E. Fisher after a Picture by R. Brompton Steel engraved portrait of Lord Chatham by W. Holl from a picture by E. Brompton Engraved portrait of the British statesman William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham (1708-1778) ('Pitt the Elder'). Sir Walter Scott records in his Journal that on 24 May 1828 the former Prime Minister Henry Addington, 1st Viscount Sidmouth showed him correspondence between Pitt the Elder and Anthony Addington (the Pitt family's physician and Sidmouth's father). Scott finds that Pitt's 'handwriting is strong and bold, and his expressions short and manly'. He notes many 'intimations of his partiality' for his son William and Pitt's concern for William's mania to copy him in all things. Comparing the correspondence of the two William Pitts, Scott reflects that Pitt the Younger lacked the 'lofty ideas' of his father, as evidenced in his very handwriting. He particularly contrasts Pitt the Elder's vigorous prosecution of war with France with Pitt the Younger's pacific instincts and tendency to underfund the armed forces, a point that Scott has previously made in his Life of Napoleon Buonaparte (1827-28). In 'The Highland Widow' (1827) Chatham is also praised for entrusting the defence of the colonies to Highlanders 'who, until his time, had been the objects of doubt, fear, and suspicion, on the part of each successive administration'. The original portrait by Brompton was painted in 1772 and the print made by Edward Fisher shortly afterwards. The Portrait Gallery of Distinguished Poets, vol. II. London: Wm. S.

Sir Walter Scott Bart. Engraved portrait of Walter Scott by W.T. Fry after T. Phillips Engraved half-length portrait of Walter Scott, aged forty-four, with a plaid of Stuart tartan over his shoulders. The dating of the half-length portrait of Scott made by Thomas Phillips for the publisher John Murray remains uncertain. In his Memoirs of the Life of Sir Walter Scott, Bart. (2nd edn, 1839), J.G. Lockhart dates it to 1818, relying on information provided by Phillips himself. In his Portraits of Sir Walter Scott, however, Francis Russell argues that 1815 is more probable (no. 157). Scott did not, in fact, visit London in 1818 but spent ten weeks there in 1815, spending a good deal of time at John Murray's where he met Byron. The engraving by Fry was first published by Boys, 1 November 1820.

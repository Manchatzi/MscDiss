Author of 'Byron & His Contemporaries' Facsimile reproduction of a print portrait of Leigh Hunt by Daniel Maclise Sketch of English author Leigh Hunt (1784-1859), with facsimile of signature. Scott wrote 'Mr. Leigh Hunt I only know from his writings but these show so much more cleverness than judgement' and considered his Lord Byron and Some of His Contemporaries to be 'injudicious and open to much censure' (letter to Horatio Smith, 1 February 1828). Scott felt that 'having eaten Byrons [sic] salt while he lived Mr Hunt should have spared his memory when he was departed'. In letters of 5 February and 4 March to J. G. Lockhart, he urged his son-in-law to treat the volume severely when reviewing it for the Quarterly Review. Hunt had already offended Scott by satirizing him in his The Feast of the Poets (1815). Writing in his Autobiography (1850), Hunt regretted the offence, wishing that political differences had not prevented him from seeing that Scott was a 'man of a kindly nature'. This facsimile reproduction is of one of a series of portraits originally published in Fraser's Magazine, 1830-1838, under the title of 'A Gallery of Illustrious Literary Characters'. Maclise, D. The Maclise Portrait Gallery of Illustrious Literary Characters, ed. W. Bates. London: Chatto and Windus, 1883 (facing p. 132)

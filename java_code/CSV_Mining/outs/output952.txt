Cabinet of Mr. Constable, (The Antiquary of the Tale) Engraved title page and frontispiece of Scott's The Antiquary Title page of The Antiquary, volume VI of a set of the Waverley Novels published by A. & C. Black, depicting Mr Constable's cabinet. Sir Walter Scott himself acknowledged that Jonathan Oldbuck, the titular character of The Antiquary (1816), was based partly on a family friend George Constable who first introduced Scott to Shakespeare. In his unfinished Autobiography (1808), Scott wrote: 'He used always to dine at my father's house of a Sunday, and was authorized to turn the conversation out of the austere and Calvinistic tone, which it usually maintained on that day, upon subjects of history or auldlangsyne. He rememberd the forty-five, and told many excellent stories, all with a strong dash of a peculiar caustic humour.' The original wood engraving was made for the Abbotsford Edition of the Waverley Novels (1842-47). The artist is Patrick Allan-Fraser who assumed his wife's surname of Fraser on his marriage in 1843. Scott, W. The Antiquary. Edinburgh: Adam and Charles Black, [185-?]

Loch Lubnaig (Perthshire): Looking North West Engraving of Loch Lubnaig by J. Swan after J. Fleming Depicts Loch Lubnaig, Stirling, and surrounding countryside. Loch Lubnaig appears in Sir Walter Scott's The Lady of the Lake (1810): 'Then, trusting not a second look, | In haste he sped him up the brook, | Nor backward glanced, till on the heath | Where Lubnaig's lake supplies the Teith' (canto III, stanza XXII, lines 5-8). Scott had first seen the Loch when travelling to Crieff in September 1796. Leighton, J.M. The Lakes of Scotland: A Series of Views. Glasgow: J. Swan, 1834 (facing p. 47)   Loch Lubnaig

Peebles and the Tweed: From Neidpath Castle Engraving of Neidpath Castle by W. Miller after P. Paton Depicts the Peebles countryside and the River Tweed from the battlements of Neidpath Castle (Scottish Borders). Neidpath Castle, near Peebles, has been suggested as the model for Saint Ronan's Castle as described in chapter I of Saint Ronan's Well (1823). Neidpath is a 14th-century castle converted into a 17th-century tower house. At the turn of the 19th century, it was home to Scott's close friend Adam Ferguson. It also features in Scott's poem 'The Maid of Neidpath', which was published in William Whyte's A Collection of Scottish Airs (1806-07): 'Disease had been in Mary's bower | And slow decay from mourning, | Though now she sits on Neidpath's tower | To watch her Love's returning' (lines 5-8). The original steel engraving was made for the Abbotsford Edition of the Waverley Novels (1842-1847). Scott, W. Saint Ronan's Well. Edinburgh: Adam and Charles Black, [185-?]   Neidpath Castle

David Ritchie: (The Original of the Black Dwarf) Engraved title page and frontispiece of Scott's The Black Dwarf Title page of The Black Dwarf, volume IX of a set of the Waverley Novels published by A. & C. Black, depicting David Ritchie, real-life model for the dwarf of the title. As Sir Walter Scott himself acknowledged in his introduction to the 'Magnum Opus' edition of The Black Dwarf (1830), the character of Elshender the Recluse was based on a real-life hermit David Ritchie. Scott had visited Ritchie's cottage while staying with his friend Captain Adam Ferguson in Peeblesshire in 1797. The Gilbert portrait of David Ritchie was originally published in the Scot's Magazine 1817. The original wood engraving, probably by Thomas Gilks after John Gilbert, was made for the Abbotsford edition of the Waverley Novels (1842-1847). Scott, W. The Black Dwarf. Edinburgh: Adam and Charles Black, [185-?]

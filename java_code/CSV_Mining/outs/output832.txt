The Right Honble. John Wilson Croker Engraved portrait of John Wilson Croker by W. Finden after T. Lawrence Engraved half-length portrait of British statesman John Wilson Croker (1780-1857). Croker was a close friend and political ally of Sir Walter Scott. In 1813 Scott wrote to Croker to suggest Robert Southey for the post of Poet Laureate (a post that Scott himself had declined). In 1818 Croker also assisted Scott in obtaining a warrant to search for the Regalia (Crown Jewels) of Scotland. In 1824 Croker persuaded Scott to join with Thomas Moore and others to found the Athenaeum Club. Their relations were momentarily strained in 1826 when Croker penned a caustic reply to Scott's Letters of Malachi Malagrowther. Scott would subsequently assist Croker with his new edition of Boswell's Life of Johnson (1831). Another work by Croker, Stories for Children from the History of England (1817), provided the model for Scott's Tales of a Grandfather (1828-1831). The original portrait by Sir Thomas Lawrence was first exhibited in 1825. Finden's engraving was published in 1838 as an illustration to H.T. Ryall's Portraits of Eminent Conservatives and Statesmen.

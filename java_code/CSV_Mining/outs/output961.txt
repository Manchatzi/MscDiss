James V. of Scotland Engraved title page and frontispiece of Scott's The Monastery Title page of The Monastery, volume XVIII of a set of the Waverley Novels published by A. & C. Black, depicting King James V of Scotland (1512-1542). Sir Walter Scott's The Monastery (1820) in the years following the death of James V, when Lowland Scotland was devastated by Henry VIII of England's 'Rough Wooing'. That is the term that Scott coined to describe Henry's military campaign (1544-1551) to bring about the marriage of the infant Mary Queen of Scots and his own son Edward Prince of Wales. This portrait is taken from a 16th-century carving made for the King's Presence Chamber in Stirling Castle (one of the 'Stirling Heads'). The original wood engraving was made for the Abbotsford Edition of the Waverley Novels (1842-1847). Scott, W. The Monastery. Edinburgh: Adam and Charles Black, [185-?]

Hogarth: From the Original Picture by Himself in the National Gallery Engraved portrait of William Hogarth by J. Mollison after W. Hogarth Engraved self-portrait of English artist William Hogarth (1697-1764) with pug dog. Walter Scott owned a Hogarth self-portrait (not that engraved here) which he displayed in the dining room at Abbotsford. Scott consistently cited Hogarth as the supreme artist. In chapter 1 of The Bride of Lammermoor (1819), the artist Dick Tinto wonders why he should shun the name of 'an out-of-doors artist' when Hogarth himself 'has introduced himself in that character in one of his best engravings'. The engraving by James Mollison was made from a self-portrait painted in 1745. The Portrait Gallery of Distinguished Poets. Vol. II. London: Wm. S. Orr & Co, 1853   Abbotsford

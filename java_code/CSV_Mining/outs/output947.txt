MacDonald of Glengarry: (The Fergus MacIvor of the Tale) Engraved title page and frontispiece of Scott's Waverley Title page of Waverley, volume I in a set of the Waverley Novels published by A. & C. Black, featuring Colonel MacDonell in full Highland dress. Scott is thought to have based many of the traits of the Highland chieftain Fergus MacIvor in Waverley (1814) on his friend Alasdair (or Alexander) Ranaldson MacDonell, 15th Chief of Glengarry. Scott described him thus in his Journal (14 February 1826): 'This gentleman is a kind of Quixote in our age, having retained, in their full extent, the whole feelings of clanship and chieftainship, elsewhere so long abandoned. He seems to have lived a century too late, and to exist, in a state of complete law and order, like a Glengarry of old, whose will was law to his sept. Warmhearted, generous, friendly, he is beloved by those who know him, and his efforts are unceasing to show kindness to those of his clan who are disposed fully to admit his pretensions. To dispute them is to incur his resentment, which has sometimes broken out in acts of violence which have brought him into collision with the law. To me he is a treasure, as being full of information as to the history of his own clan, and the manners and customs of the Highlanders in general.' Glengarry gifted Scott the deerhounds Maida (1816) and Nimrod (1824). The original wood engraving was made for the Abbotsford edition of the Waverley Novels (1842-1847). Scott, W. Waverley.

Sir Humphrey Davy, Bart. P.R.S. : By Permission From the Large Print Published by Messrs. Agnew & Lanitti Engraved portrait of Sir Humphry Davy by J. Jenkins after J. Lonsdale. Engraved portrait of British scientist Sir Humphry Davy (1778-1829), with facsimile of signature. Sir Walter Scott and Davy were fellow guests of William Wordsworth's at Dove Cottage, Grasemere, in August 1805. Scott 'liked him excessively' and was 'particularly delighted with the total absence of pedantry which has always appeared to me the test of true genius' (letter to Jane Kerr Apreece, 2 April 1811). Davy later made two visits to Scott at Abbotsford in 1820 and 1823. In 1812 Davy had become a member of Scott's extended family by marrying his widowed cousin Jane Kerr Apreece. As a favour to her Scott wrote a review of Davy's Salmoniana for the Quarterly Review in 1828. Taylor, W.C. The National Portrait Gallery of Illustrious and Eminent Personages, vol. I.

Chaucer. From a Limning in Occleve's Poems in the British Museum Steel engraved portrait of Chaucer by J. Thomson after Occleve Engraved portrait of the English poet Geoffrey Chaucer (d. 1400). 'Of all Chaucer's multifarious powers', wrote Sir Walter Scott in his Life of Dryden (1808), 'none is more wonderful than the humour with which he touched upon natural frailty, and the truth with which he describes the inward feelings of the human heart'. Chaucer is frequently cited throughout Scott's works, particularly as an authoritative source on medieval life and manners. In Peveril of the Peak (ch. 21) and Woodstock (ch. 16), Scott introduces Chaucer enthusiasts who lament the neglect into which the poet has fallen. Chaucer's unpopularity continued into Scott's day, his project of a hundred-volume edition of the British poets foundering upon his insistence that it begin with Chaucer. A correspondent, Anna Seward, even wrote that Dryden, Spencer, and Chaucer seems to her 'overpraised' and that 'not one of them equals yourself or Southey' (29 January 1807). Scott replied that 'My admiration of Chaucer Spenser and Dryden does not blind me to their faults for I see the coarsness [sic] of the first the tediousness occasiond [sic] by the continued allegory of the second and the inequalities of the last but my dear Miss Seward "in these days were giants in the land" and we are but dwarfs beside them' (20 February 1807). The engraving by Thomson is taken after an illuminated portrait of Chaucer in a manuscript of Thomas Occleve's Regiment of Princes (1412). The Portrait Gallery of Distinguished Poets, vol. I.

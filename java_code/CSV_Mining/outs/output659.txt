Jedburgh Abbey Facsimile of a pencil drawing of Jedburgh Abbey by G. Home Depicts the ruins of Jedburgh Abbey, Scottish Borders, with the River Tweed in the foreground. Sir Walter Scott describes Jedburgh Abbey in his 'Essay on Border Antiquities' (1814), inaccurately praising its Anglo-Norman chapter-house as 'a very perfect specimen of Saxon architecture'. There are further references in The Black Dwarf and The Monastery. The Abbey was built by David I around 1138 but fell into ruin by the mid-sixteenth century. Scott was a frequent visitor to Jedburgh in his capacity as Sheriff Depute of Selkirkshire. He subscribed å£10 toward the repair-work on the Abbey's tower in 1824-1826. Baikie, J.

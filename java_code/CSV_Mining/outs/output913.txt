View of the Clyde above Erskine Ferry Lithograph of the Clyde River by E. Walker after W. L. Leitch Depicts the Clyde river valley from Erskine Ferry. The Clyde River features in a number of works by Walter Scott, notably Rob Roy (1817), The Heart of Mid-Lothian (1818), and Old Mortality (1816). In Rob Roy, Frank Osbaldistone travels through the Clyde valley on his way to Glasgow (ch. 19). In The Heart of Mid-Lothian, Jeanie Deans 'travelled through a thousand beautiful and changing views down the side of that noble stream' on her way to Inverary (ch. 40). Old Mortality, meanwhile, is set in Clydesdale, and much of the action takes place on the banks of the river. Lawson, J.P. Scotland Delineated: In a Series of Views by Clarkson Stanfield. London: J.

Walter Scott, Esqr. Engraved portrait of Sir Walter Scott by C. Heath after H. Raeburn Half-length portrait facing left of Sir Walter Scott at the age of thirty-six. Scott sat for the original portrait by Sir Henry Raeburn in spring 1808. Commissioned by Archibald Constable, it was completed in the same year. It is now in the possession of the Duke of Buccleuch and Queensberry at Bowhill. Charles Heath's engraving, first published by Constable, Edinburgh, in 1820, is itself derived from an earlier engraving, made by Henry Meyer and published in the New Monthly Magazine, 1818 (see record 1039).

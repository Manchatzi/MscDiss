Eveline Berenger Engraved portrait by C.E. Wagstaff after J. Inskipp of the heroine of Scott's novel The Betrothed Engraved half-length portrait of Eveline Berenger, heroine of Sir Walter Scott's novel The Betrothed (1825). This portrait of Eveline Berenger, heroine of Sir Walter Scott's The Betrothed (1825), was inspired by the following line in ch. 8: 'The morning light was scarce fully spread abroad, when Eveline Berenger, in compliance with her confessor's advice, commenced her progress around the walls and battlements of the beleaguered castle.' Eveline's father, the Anglo-Norman Raymond Berenger, has refused her hand to the Welsh prince Gwenwyn, and the incensed Gwenwyn has laid siege to the Berengers' castle of Garde Douloureuse.

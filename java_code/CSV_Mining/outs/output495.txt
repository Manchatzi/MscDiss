Erskine: From the Original picture by Hoppner in his Majesty's collection at Windsor Steel engraved portrait of Baron Erskine by R. Woodman after a picture by Hoppner Engraved portrait of the lawyer and Whig politician Baron Thomas Erskine (1750-1823). Erskine was Lord Chancellor from 1806 to 1807. In his Journal for 20 April 1829, Sir Walter Scott describes him as 'positively mad', recalling 'him tell a cock-and-a-bull story of having seen the ghost of his father's servant, John Burnet, with as much sincerity as if he believed every word he was saying'. Scott refers to the same episode in slightly more measured terms in a letter to Lady Abercorn (13 September 1822), describing Lord Londonderry 'as the only man I ever heard affirm that he had seen an apparition excepting Lord Erskine a person of so flighty a character that one does not wonder at anything he could say'. Scott credited Erskine with a portion of his family's wit but of a 'moody and maddish' kind. He acknowledged, however, that 'I never saw him in his best days' (Journal, 20 April 1829). The original portrait by John Hoppner was painted in 1787 or 1788. The Portrait Gallery of Distinguished Poets, vol. III. London: Wm. S. Orr & Co., 1853

Raleigh: From a Picture in the Collection of the Duchess of Dorset Engraved portrait of Sir Walter Raleigh by J. Posselwhite after an unknown artist Engraved portrait of Sir Walter Raleigh (ca. 1552-1618), taken from a larger work featuring Raleigh and his son. Raleigh proves himself a friend to the hero Edmund Tressilian in Sir Walter Scott's novel Kenilworth (1821). He is described as knowing 'better than almost any of the courtiers who surrounded her, how to mingle the devotion claimed by the Queen [Elizabeth I] with the gallantry due to her personal beauty'. The original portrait was painted by an unknown artist in 1590. The Portrait Gallery of Distinguished Poets, vol. I. London: Wm. S. Orr & Co., 1853

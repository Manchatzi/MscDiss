Gowrie Tower, the Tay, and Bridge, Perth Engraved title page and frontispiece of Scott's The Fair Maid of Perth Title page of The Fair Maid of Perth, volume XLII of a set of the Waverley Novels published by A. & C. Black, depicting the Perth Bridge. Describing Perth in ch. I of The Fair Maid of Perth (1828), Sir Walter Scott regrets the demolition in 1809 of Gowrie House or Tower, the scene of the alleged 'Gowrie Conspiracy' against James VI in 1600. The bridge portrayed here was built in 1771 and is therefore not the one featured in the novel which was destroyed by a flood in 1621. The original wood engraving, possibly by Edward Evans, was made for the Abbotsford edition of the Waverley Novels (1842-1847). Scott, W. The Fair Maid of Perth.

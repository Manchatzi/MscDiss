Hampden: From a Print by J. Houbraken 1740 Steel engraved portrait of John Hampden by J. Posselwhite after a print by J. Houbraken Engraved portrait of the English parliamentarian John Hampden (1594-1643). Hampden was staunchly opposed to autocratic rule of Charles I, particularly the King's attempts to levy the 'ship money' tax. There are several references to Hampden in Scott's novels of 17th-century England and Scotland. In Old Mortality (1816), the putative narrator Peter Pattieson writes that many Covenanters 'united the independent sentiments of a Hampden with the suffering zeal of a Hooper or Latimer' (ch. 1). In Woodstock (1826), the hostility of the wolfhound Bevis to the fugitive Charles II leads the King to believe that 'the spirit of Pym or Hampden has transmigrated into the rogue and continues to demonstrate his hatred against royalty and all its adherents' (ch. 24). In an Appendix to the Introduction to the 'Magnum Opus' edition of Peveril of the Peak (1831), Scott writes that 'the adventures ascribed to "historical characters" would, however, fail in their moral aim, if fiction were placed at variance with truth; if Hampden or Sydney, for example, were painted as swindlers'. Finally, a note to the 'Magnum' edition of Ivanhoe (1830) reveals that Scott borrowed his hero's name 'from a manor forfeited by the ancestor of the celebrated Hampden, for striking the Black Prince a blow with his racket, when they quarrelled at tennis'.

Queen Mary's Bedchamber Engraving of Mary, Queen of Scot's Bedchamber by J. Lewis after G. Cattermole Depicts Mary, Queen of Scots' bedchamber in the Palace of Holyroodhouse, Edinburgh (with a seated Sir Walter Scott). The murderers of Mary Stuart's secretary David Rizzio dragged their victim from the Queen's presence into the royal bedchamber at the Palace of Holyroodhouse before dispatching him. This episode is described in Sir Walter Scott's Tales of a Grandfather, First Series (1828).There are further references to the murder in The Abbot and Chronicles of the Canongate. The bedchamber was also the birth-place of Mary's son James who would unite the kingdoms of England and Scotland. He is a central character in Scott's 1822 novel The Fortunes of Nigel.

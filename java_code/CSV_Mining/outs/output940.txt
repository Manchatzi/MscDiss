New Assembly Hall, Edinburgh Lithograph of the Assembly Hall, Edinburgh by T. Picken after W. L. Leitch Depicts the Assembly Hall of the Church of Scotland, Edinburgh (now The Hub) and a crowded Castle Hill. Sir Walter Scott was born and raised in Edinburgh and worked there, first as an Advocate from 1792 to 1806, then as Clerk of the Court of Session until his retirement in 1830. The city features in many of his works, most notably The Heart of Mid-Lothian (1818). The building portrayed here, Assembly Hall on Castle Hill, was built in 1842-44, a decade after Scott's death. Scott did, however, give a description and historical account of the High Street in Provincial Antiquities and Picturesque Scenery of Scotland (1826), noting, not uncritically, the many innovations made during his own lifetime. These had effectively extended the street to Castle Hill. Lawson, J.P. Scotland Delineated: In a Series of Views by Clarkson Stanfield. London: J. Hogarth, 1847-1854   Edinburgh

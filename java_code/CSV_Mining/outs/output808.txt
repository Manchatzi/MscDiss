Lord Chancellor Somers: From a Picture by Sir G. Kneller, in the Possession of the Royal Society Engraved portrait of Baron Somers by T. A. Dean after G. Kneller Engraved half-length portrait of John Somers, Lord Chancellor of England (1651-1716). Between 1809 and 1815, Sir Walter Scott prepared a revised edition of A Collection of Scarce and Valuable Tracts: On the Most Interesting and Entertaining Subjects: But Chiefly Such as Relate to the History and Constitution of these Kingdoms. Generally known as the Somers Tracts, this collection of historical pamphlets was largely drawn from the library of John Somers, Lord Chancellor of England, 1697-1700. Scott had found the original edition (published 1748-1751) particularly helpful when preparing his edition of the works of Dryden (1808). The original portrait of Baron Somers by Sir Godfrey Kneller was painted ca. 1715-1716. The Portrait Gallery of Distinguished Poets, vol. II. London: Wm. S. Orr & Co., 1853

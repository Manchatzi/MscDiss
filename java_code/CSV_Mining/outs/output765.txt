Francis Horner, 1778-1817 Facsimile of a portrait of Francis Horner by H. Raeburn Portrait of English politician and economist Francis Horner (1778-1817). Francis Horner was one of the founders of the Edinburgh Review, to which Scott contributed reviews between 1803 and 1806 before withdrawing for political reasons. Scott found Horner's writings solemn and humourless: 'I will not admire your Horner: he always puts me in mind of Obadiah's bull, who, although, as Father Shandy observed, he never produced a calf, went through his business with such a grave demeanour, that he always maintained his credit in the parish!' (quoted in J. G. Lockhart, Memoirs of the Life of Sir Walter Scott, Bart.). Horner was also a founding member with Scott of the influential literary and social 'Friday Club' in 1803. The original portrait by Henry Raeburn was painted in 1812. The History of the Speculative Society, 1764-1904. Edinburgh: Printed for the Society by T. and A. Constable, 1905

Aisle of St. Magnus' Cathedral, Kirkwall Engraved title page and frontispiece of Scott's The Pirate Title page of The Pirate, volume XXIV of a set of the Waverley Novels published by A. & C. Black, depicting St. Magnus Cathedral, Kirkwall, Orkney. In Sir Walter Scott's The Pirate (1821), St. Magnus Cathedral in Kirkwall, Orkney, is the scene of decisive encounters between Captain Cleveland and Minna Troil (ch. 37) and between Mordaunt Mertoun and Ulla Troil (ch. 41). Scott, who had visited Orkney in 1814, described the Cathedral as 'of the heaviest order of Gothic architecture, but grand, solemn, and stately, the work of a distant age, and of a powerful hand' (The Pirate, ch. 31). The original wood engraving was made for the Abbotsford Edition of the Waverley Novels (1842-1847). There the engraving itself gives the artist's name as Dickes and the engraver as Mary A. Williams, but the list of illustrations gives the artist's name as Elizabeth Leveson-Gower, Duchess-Countess of Sutherland. Scott, W. The Pirate.

Lord Darnley Engraved title page and frontispiece of Scott's The Abbot Title page of The Abbot, volume XXI of a set of the Waverley Novels published by A. & C. Black, depicting Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley (1545-1567) as a child. Following the murder of Lord Darnley, second husband of Mary Queen of Scots (1567), and Mary's subsequent remarriage to the Earl of Bothwell, the Scottish Lords confronted the Queen and imprisoned her in Loch Leven Castle. Her escape from captivity is the subject of Walter Scott's The Abbot (1820). In ch. 22 of the novel she proclaims herself innocent of involvement in the murder of Darnley, but acknowledge that by marrying the chief suspect she has laid herself open to suspicion. The original wood engraving was made for the Abbotsford Edition of the Waverley Novels (1842-1847) by a member of the Dalziel family of engravers, possibly George (1815-1902). It derives ultimately from a late 16th- or early 17th-century engraving by Renold Elstrack. Scott, W. The Abbot. Edinburgh: Adam and Charles Black, [185-?]

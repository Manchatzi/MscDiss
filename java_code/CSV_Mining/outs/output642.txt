Floors Castle Kelso Facsimile of a pencil drawing of Floors Castle by G. Home Depicts a view of Floors Castle, Kelso, Scottish Borders, and grounds. Scott was a frequent visitor to Floors (formerly Fleurs) Castle which was built by William Adam for the 1st Duke of Roxburghe in 1721. In his unfinished Autobiography (1808) Sir Walter Scott describes the awakening of a sense of beauty during childhood stays in Kelso, 'the most beautiful, if not the most romantic, village in Scotland'. Among its sights, he lists the castle 'which is so situated as to combine the ideas of ancient baronial grandeur with those of modern taste'. He again praises the beauty of Floors Castle in Letters on Demonology and Witchcraft (1830). Baikie, J. The Charm of the Scott Country. London: A. & C. Black, 1927 (facing p. 28)   Floors Castle

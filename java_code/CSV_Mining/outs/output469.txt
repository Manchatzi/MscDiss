Lord Clarendon: From the Picture in the Bodleian Library, Oxford Steel engraved portrait of Lord Clarendon by C. E. Wagstaff Engraved portrait of the English politician and historian Edward Hyde, Earl of Clarendon. Sir Walter Scott frequently cited Clarendon's History of the Rebellion and Civil Wars in England. It proved an invaluable source for his Tales of a Grandfather, Second Series (1829) and for his novels of 17th-century England, The Fortunes of Nigel (1822), Peveril of the Peak (1823), and Woodstock (1826). In a letter of 21 November 1821, Scott recommended that his son Charles read Clarendon: '[H]is stile [sic] is a little long-winded but on the other hand his Characters may match those of the Ancient historians and one thinks they would know the very men if you were to meet them in society: few English writers have the same precision either in describing the actors in great scenes or the actions which they performed. He was you are aware himself deeply engaged in the scenes which he describes and therefore mentions them with the individual feeling and sometimes doubtless with the partiality of a partizan [sic]. Yet I think he is on the whole a fair writer for though he always endeavours to excuse King Chas. yet he points out his mistakes and errors which certainly were neither few nor of slight consequence.' The engraving by Wagstaff is from an original portrait by Sir Peter Lely. The Portrait Gallery of Distinguished Poets, vol. II. London: Wm. S. Orr & Co., 1853

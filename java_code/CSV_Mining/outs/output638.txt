West Bow, Edinburgh Engraving of West Bow, Edinburgh by J. Cousen after G. Cattermole Depicts a street scene in West Bow, Edinburgh. In The Heart of Mid-Lothian (1818), ch. 3, a group of people including Bartoline Saddletree and Reuben Butler discuss the reprieve of Captain Porteous while returning to their houses in the Lawnmarket via 'the steep declivity of the West Bow'. The West Bow was originally a steep winding road leading from the Grassmarket (site of the gallows) to Castle Hill, offering the only means of access to Edinburgh Castle from the South. It was largely demolished in the 1830s when Victoria Street and George IV Bridge were built to provide more convenient access. Only a small portion of the West Bow now survives at the foot of Victoria Street. Stevens, H.I. & A. Scott and Scotland, or, Historical and Romantic Illustrations of Scottish Story. London: H.I. & A.

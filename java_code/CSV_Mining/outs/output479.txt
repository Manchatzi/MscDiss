Cranmer: From an Original Picture in the Collection at Lambeth Palace Steel engraved portrait of Thomas Cranmer by W. Holl Engraved portrait of Thomas Cranmer (1489-1556), Archbishop of Canterbury and Protestant theologian. Although there appears to be no direct reference to Thomas Cranmer in Scott's works, he is significant as author of The Book of Common Prayer, attempts to introduce which into Scotland gave birth to the Covenanting movement. In Old Mortality (1816) the hero Henry Morton when awaiting death instinctively recites the 'petition for deliverance and for composure of spirit which is to be found in the Book of Common Prayer of the Church of England' (ch. 33). This is taken as evidence of treason to the Covenanting cause, and overcomes Ephraim MacBriar's reluctance to have him executed. The engraving is derived ultimately from a 16th-century woodcut by an unknown artist. The Portrait Gallery of Distinguished Poets, vol. I. London: Wm. S. Orr & Co., 1853

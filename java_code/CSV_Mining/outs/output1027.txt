Skiddaw and Saddleback: From Bolton Moor. Engraving of Skiddaw and Saddleback by R. Brandard after C. Stanfield Depicts Bolton Moor, Cumbria, with Skiddaw and Saddleback mountains in the background. In ch. 22 of Guy Mannering (1815), Sir Walter Scott describes the hero Henry Bertram setting out on foot from Cumbria to Scotland: 'Let the reader conceive to himself a clear frosty November morning, the scene an open heath,--having for the background that huge chain of mountains in which Skiddaw and Saddleback are pre-eminent.' Scott met his wife Charlotte when holidaying in the Lake District in 1797. He made further visits to the region in 1805, 1813, and 1825. The original steel engraving was made for the Abbotsford Edition of the Waverley Novels (1842-1847). Scott, W. Guy Mannering. Edinburgh: Adam and Charles Black, [185-?] Lake District Skiddaw

Grey Friar's Church: Burnt Down, 1845 Engraving of Greyfriars Kirk, Edinburgh by T. Steuart after D. Wilson Presents a view of Greyfriars Kirk, Edinburgh, from (modern-day) Bristo Place, with Heriot's Hospital in the background. Greyfriars Kirk is mentioned in a number of Scott's novels, notably Guy Mannering and Redgauntlet. Scott's father and sister were both buried in the Scott family burial-plot in the Kirkyard. According to Lockhart, Scott also first made the acquaintance of his first love Williamina Belsches in the Kirkyard. Much of the older part of the church was destroyed by fire in 1845, but the building had been successfully restored by 1857. Wilson, D. Memorials of Edinburgh in the Olden Time. Vol. II.

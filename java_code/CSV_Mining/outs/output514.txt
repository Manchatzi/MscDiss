Handel: From a Picture in the Collection of His Majesty at Windsor Steel engraved portrait of Handel by J. Thomson after a painting by T. Hudson Engraved portrait of the German-British composer Georg Friedrich Handel (1685-1759). Sir Walter Scott was, by his own admission, no connoisseur of music. When his wife Charlotte attended the Edinburgh Music Festival in 1815, the highlight of which was a performance of Handel's Messiah, Scott preferred to stay at Abbotsford. He wrote that he was 'delighted with your having found the gaieties of the time acceptable' but that he would not 'give one "wheeble of a whaup" from the moss at Keaside for all the fine music you have heard' (letter of 11 November 1805). Scott nonetheless named Handel as pre-eminent in the art of music in his Life of Dryden (1808), where Handel's setting of Dryden's 'Alexander's Feast' is discussed. Handel is also quoted as identifying the morris dance as the quintessential English dance in a note to the Magnum Opus edition of The Fair Maid of Perth (1832). This engraving is based on a 1756 portrait of Handel by Thomas Hudson, now in the National Portrait Gallery. The Portrait Gallery of Distinguished Poets, vol. II. London: Wm. S. Orr & Co., 1853

Goethe: From a Picture by George Dawe. Esqr. RA in the Possession of Henry Dawe Esq Steel engraved portrait of Goethe by J. Posselwhite after a painting by George Dawe Engraved portrait of the German author Johann Wolfgang von Goethe (1749-1832). Sir Walter Scott began his literary career with a series of translations from contemporary German literature. Of Goethe, the European writer whom Scott most admired, he translated Goetz of Berlichingen (1799), 'The Erl-King' (1799), 'Frederick and Alice' (1800), and 'Lamentation of the Faithful Wife of Asan Aga' (1806). Scott described Goethe as 'a wonderful fellow, the Ariosto at once, and almost the Voltaire of Germany' (Journal, 15 February 1827) and acclaimed him as 'an author born to arouse the slumbering fame of his country' (Introduction to 'Magnum' edition of Anne of Geierstein, 1831). Scott was bitterly disappointed that Goethe's death on 22 March 1832 thwarted a long-cherished plan to visit him at Weimar. Goethe, in his turn, was a great admirer of the Waverley Novels, praising Scott in a letter of 12 January 1827 for his 'wonderful pictures of human life'. Deeply flattered, Scott sent Goethe a copy of his Life of Napoleon Buonaparte and hailed him as 'the father of the German literature' (letter of 9 July 1827). The original portrait by George Dawe was painted in 1819. The Portrait Gallery of Distinguished Poets, vol. III. London: Wm. S. Orr & Co., 1853

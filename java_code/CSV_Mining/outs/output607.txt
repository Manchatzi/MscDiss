Dryburgh Abbey: Sir Walter Scott's Sepulchre Engraving of the ruins of Dryburgh Abbey by J. Johnstone after J. Bower Depicts the ruins of Dryburgh Abbey, Scottish Borders, and the burial place of Sir Walter Scott. Sir Walter Scott was interred in St. Mary's Aisle, Dryburgh Abbey, on September 26, 1832. Scott lamented in his 'Autobiography' that, though his ancestors, the Haliburtons, once owned the Abbey, 'we have nothing left of Dryburgh... but the right of stretching our bones.' Scott's wife, Margaret Charlotte Carpenter, his eldest son, Walter Scott, and his son-in-law and biographer, J.G. Lockhart, are also buried here. The print was made by one, or possibly both, of the Edinburgh engravers James and John Johnstone. The History and Antiquities of Melrose, Old Melrose, and Dryburgh Abbeys. Melrose: J.

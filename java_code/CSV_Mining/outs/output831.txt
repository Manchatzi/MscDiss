John Wilson Croker, Esqr., M.P., Secretary to the Admiralty: Engraved by T. Blood for the European Magazine From an Original Painting by S. Drummond A.R.A. Engraved portrait of John Wilson Croker by T. Blood after S. Drummond Engraved portrait of British statesman John Wilson Croker (1780-1857) in a fur-collared coat. Croker was a close friend and political ally of Sir Walter Scott. In 1813 Scott wrote to Croker to suggest Robert Southey for the post of Poet Laureate (a post that Scott himself had declined). In 1818 Croker also assisted Scott in obtaining a warrant to search for the Regalia (Crown Jewels) of Scotland. In 1824 Croker persuaded Scott to join with Thomas Moore and others to found the Athenaeum Club. Their relations were momentarily strained in 1826 when Croker penned a caustic reply to Scott's Letters of Malachi Malagrowther. Scott would subsequently assist Croker with his new edition of Boswell's Life of Johnson (1831). Another work by Croker, Stories for Children from the History of England (1817), provided the model for Scott's Tales of a Grandfather (1828-1831). The original portrait by Samuel Drummond was probably commissioned by the European Magazine in 1812. European Magazine, and London Review. London: Fielding, Debrett, & Sewell, 1782-1826

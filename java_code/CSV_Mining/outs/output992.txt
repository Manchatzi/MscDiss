[Engraving of a Highland Pass, near Gairloch, by W. Richardson after C. Stanfield]  Depicts a deep canyon and two Highlanders by a fallen tree. In ch. 49 of Sir Walter Scott's The Heart of Midlothian (1818), Lady Staunton (the former Effie Deans) becomes trapped while visiting a waterfall in the vicinity of Gairloch (Ross and Cromarty). The artist has chosen a spot matching the description: 'A single shoot carried a considerable stream over the face of a black rock, which contrasted strongly in colour with the white foam of the cascade, and, at the depth of about twenty feet, another rock intercepted the view of the bottom of the fall. The water, wheeling out far beneath, swept round the crag, which thus bounded their view, and tumbled down the rocky glen in a torrent of foam.' The original steel engraving was made for the Abbotsford Edition of the Waverley Novels (1842-1847). Scott, W. The Heart of Midlothian. Edinburgh: Adam and Charles Black, [185-?]   Wester Ross

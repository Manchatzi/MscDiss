Sir Walter Scott Engraved portrait of Sir Walter Scott by M.I. Danforth after C.R. Leslie Three-quarter length portrait of Sir Walter Scott at the age of fifty-three, seated with his coat of arms and motto ('Watch weel') in the background. Scott sat for the original portrait by Charles Robert Leslie in September 1824. Commissioned by the American man of letters George Ticknor, the painting was completed in 1824 and is now held by the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston. Leslie made a copy of his portrait for Archibald Constable, from which this engraving is probably derived. Danforth's engraving was published in the Literary Souvenir in 1829.

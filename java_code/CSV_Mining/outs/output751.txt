Traquair Engraving of Traquair by D. Wilson after D.O. Hill Depicts a shepherd with his flock in the countryside of Traquair, Scottish Borders. Traquair House, near Peebles, parts of which date from the twelfth century, is considered to be the oldest continually inhabited house in Scotland. It was one of Walter Scott's favourite haunts and has been suggested as a model for the castles of Tully Veolan in Waverley (1814) and Ellieslaw in The Black Dwarf (1816). The area around Traquair and Innerleithen is thought to be the setting for Scott's Saint Ronan's Well (1823). Hogg, J. Tales and Sketches by the Ettrick Shepherd. Vol. VI.

St. Mary's Loch & the Loch o' the Lowes Facsimile of a pencil drawing of St. Mary's Loch by G. Home Depicts St. Mary's Loch and the Loch o' the Lowes, Scottish Borders. Sir Walter Scott most famously describes St. Mary's Loch in Marmion (1808): 'Oft in my mind such thoughts awake, | By lone Saint Mary's silent lake; | Thou know'st it well,---nor fen, nor sedge, | Pollute the pure lake's crystal edge; | Abrupt and sheer, the mountains sink | At once upon the level brink; | And just a trace of silver sand | Marks where the water meets the land' (Introduction to Canto Second, lines 146-153). Scott made many excursions to the loch, situated near Moffat in the Scottish Borders. The surrounding landscape (Moffatdale) is featured in Old Mortality (1816). Baikie, J.

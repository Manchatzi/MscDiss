Foot of the West Bow Lithograph of West Bow, Edinburgh, by T. Picken after G. Cattermole Depicts a crowded street scene at the foot of West Bow, Edinburgh. West Bow was originally a steep winding road leading from the Grassmarket to Castle Hill, offering the only means of access to Edinburgh Castle from the South. It was largely demolished in the 1830s when Victoria Street and George IV Bridge were built to provide more convenient access. Only a small portion of the West Bow now survives at the foot of Victoria Street. Lawson, J.P. Scotland Delineated: In a Series of Views by Clarkson Stanfield. London: J.

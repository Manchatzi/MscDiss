High Street: From Head of West Bow, Lawnmarket Lithograph of High Street, Edinburgh by T. Picken after W. L. Leitch Depicts the junction of West Bow and High Street, Edinburgh. Sir Walter Scott was born and raised in Edinburgh and worked there, first as an Advocate from 1792 to 1806, then as Clerk of the Court of Session until his retirement in 1830. The city features in many of his works, most notably The Heart of Mid-Lothian (1818). Scott gives a description and historical account of the High Street in Provincial Antiquities & Picturesque Scenery of Scotland (1826), noting, not uncritically, the many innovations made during his own lifetime. The view of the High Street presented in this engraving was only made possible by the demolition of the Old Tolbooth and Luckenbooths in 1817. These buildings had previously stood between the Lawnmarket and the High Street proper. Scott still maintained that 'under all its mutilations, the High Street of Edinburgh is the most magnificent in Great Britain, excepting perhaps the High Street of Oxford'. Lawson, J.P.

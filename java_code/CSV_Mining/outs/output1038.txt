Walter Scott, Esq.: Engraved For the New Monthly Magazine, by Hy. Meyer Engraved portrait of Walter Scott by H. Meyer after H. Raeburn Engraved portrait of Walter Scott at the age of thirty-six. The original portrait by Sir Henry Raeburn was commissioned by Scott's publisher Archibald Constable in 1808. It is now part of the collection at Bowhill, seat of the Duke of Buccleuch. Meyer's engraving was published in the November 1818 issue of the New Monthly Magazine. It is based on an earlier engraving by Charles Picart (1811) made from a drawing by William Evans. Evans substituted the outdoor backdrop of Raeburn's portrait for an interior suggestive of the writer's study. New Monthly Magazine, 1 November, 1818

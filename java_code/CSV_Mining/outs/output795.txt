William Pitt: From a Picture by Hoppner in the Possession of the Publisher Engraved portrait of William Pitt the Younger by J. Posselwhite after J. Hoppner Engraved portrait of William Pitt the Younger (1759-1806) during his second term as Prime Minister. Walter Scott mourned the recently deceased Pitt the Younger in Marmion (1808): 'The mind that thought for Britain's weal,... | While faith and civil peace are dear, | Grace this cold marble with a tear,--- | He, who preserved them, Pitt, lies here!' (Introduction to Canto First, lines 61, 123-125). Pitt, for his part, was a great admirer of The Lay of the Last Minstrel (1805) and told Scott's childhood friend William Dundas that 'it would give him pleasure to advance the fortunes of such a writer'. When Scott was told of Pitt's admiration, he wrote that 'I can say without affectation that I would rather have the satisfaction of having been approved by him, though now dead, than by all the living statesmen and nobility in Europe' (letter to Lady Abercorn, 20 September 1806). The original portrait by John Hoppner was painted in 1804/05. The Portrait Gallery of Distinguished Poets, vol. III. London: Wm. S. Orr & Co., 1853

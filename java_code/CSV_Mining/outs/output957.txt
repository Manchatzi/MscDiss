Queen Anne Engraved title page and frontispiece of Scott's The Bride of Lammermoor Title page of The Bride of Lammermoor, volume XIV of a set of the Waverley Novels published by A. & C. Black, depicting Queen Anne (1665-1714). Sir Walter Scott's The Bride of Lammermoor (1819) is set during the reign of Queen Anne in the years immediately preceding the Act of Union between England and Scotland (1707). The novel takes place at a time when the Jacobite party appears to be in the ascendant on both sides of the Border in the expectation that the Queen would be succeeded by her brother James (later known as the 'Old Pretender'). The Dickes portrait derives from a portrait by Sir Godfrey Kneller (ca. 1690) probably via the intermediary of earlier engravings. The wood engraving was originally made for the Abbotsford Edition of the Waverley Novels (1842-1847). Scott, W. The Bride of Lammermoor. Edinburgh: Adam and Charles Black, [185-?]

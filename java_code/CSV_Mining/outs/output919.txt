Sir Walter Scott, Bart. Engraved portrait by W. Holl from a bust of Sir Walter Scott by Sir F. Chantrey Engraved portrait depicting a side view of Chantrey's bust of Sir Walter Scott.

This engraving is from the marble replica (known as the 'Abbotsford Bust') that Chantrey made for Scott in 1821. It was first published in Knight's Gallery of Portraits, VII (1837). The engraver was probably William Holl the Younger (1807-71) but may have been his father William Holl the Elder (ca. 1771-1838). Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge.

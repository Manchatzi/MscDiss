Dryburgh Abbey Facsimile of a watercolour of Dryburgh Abbey by William Smith Depicts Gothic arches at Dryburgh Abbey, Scottish Borders, and a vista of Scott's burial place. Sir Walter Scott was interred in St. Mary's Aisle, Dryburgh Abbey, on September 26, 1832. Scott lamented in his 'Autobiography' that, though his ancestors, the Haliburtons, once owned the Abbey, 'we have nothing left of Dryburgh... but the right of stretching our bones.' Scott's wife, Margaret Charlotte Carpenter, his eldest son, Walter Scott, and his son-in-law and biographer, J.G. Lockhart, are also buried here. Smith, W., et al. Scott Country: Water-colours.

Lochmaben Castle Engraving of Lochmaben Castle by J.T. Willmore after J.M.W. Turner Engraved title page for The Poetical Works of Walter Scott, vol. III, with vignette depicting the ruins of Lochmaben Castle, Dumfries and Galloway. Lochmaben Castle near Dumfries was the seat of the Bruce family in their capacity as Lords of Annandale and has been proposed by some historians as the birthplace of Robert the Bruce, hero of Sir Walter Scott's The Lord of the Isles (1815). Built in the 13th century, the castle lay in ruins by Scott's time. There are further references to Lochmaben Castle and the Bruces in Scott's The Monastery and The Abbot (both 1820) and in the traditional ballad 'The Lochmaben Harper' which Scott included in his Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border (1802-1803).

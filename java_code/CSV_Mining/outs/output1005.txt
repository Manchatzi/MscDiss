Royal Palace, Whitehall: As Designed by Inigo Jones Engraving of the Royal Palace at Whitehall by J. Horsburgh after G.H. Dodgson Depicts the Palace of Whitehall, London, and the River Thames. In Walter Scott's The Fortunes of Nigel (1822), the hero Nigel Olifaunt, Lord Glenvarloch travels to the court of King James VI and I at Whitehall, in order to reclaim a sum of money lent to the King by his father. The palace was then undergoing a major modernization at the hands of Inigo Jones. Nigel thus finds the King 'amidst the rubbish of old buildings, and the various confusion attending the erection of the new pile, which formed at present a labyrinth not easily traversed' (ch. 5). A fire in the Palace on 4 January 1698 destroyed all except Inigo Jones's Banqueting Hall. The original steel engraving, from a drawing in the British Museum, was made for the Abbotsford Edition of the Waverley Novels (1842-1847). Scott, W. Waverley Novels. Abbotsford Edition, vol. VII. Edinburgh: R. Cadell, 1845, facing p. 293 London Whitehall Palace

The Author of 'The Pleasures of Memory' Facsimile reproduction of a print portrait of Samuel Rogers by Daniel Maclise Facsimile of a sketch of English poet Samuel Rogers (1763-1855), seated in an armchair, with facsimile of signature. Sir Walter Scott met Rogers when visiting London in 1803. He frequently breakfasted with Rogers in subsequent visits to London and corresponded with him. Rogers supported and wrote for the Quarterly Review (the journal that Scott set up to rival the Whig Edinburgh Review) and contributed a lyric to Scott's English Minstrelsy (1810). In a letter to J. G. Lockhart, Scott describes Rogers as 'a man of honour and humanity when out of his poetical character in which he harbours a little too much irritability' (30 May 1826). This facsimile reproduction is of one of a series of portraits originally published in Fraser's Magazine, 1830-1838, under the title 'A Gallery of Illustrious Literary Characters'. Maclise, D. The Maclise Portrait Gallery of Illustrious Literary Characters, ed. W. Bates. London: Chatto and Windus, 1883 (facing p. 14)

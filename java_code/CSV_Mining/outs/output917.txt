The 'Prentice Pillar', Roslin Chapel Lithograph of the interior of Rosslyn Chapel and the 'Prentice Pillar' by T. Picken after W. L. Leitch Depicts some of the elaborate carvings of the interior of Rosslyn Chapel, Midlothian, including the 'Prentice Pillar'. Rosslyn (or Roslin) Chapel is featured in Sir Walter Scott's Lay of the Last Minstrel (1805) in the ballad of 'Rosabelle' recited by the bard Harold: 'Seem'd all on fire that chapel proud, | Where Roslin's chiefs uncoffin'd lie... | Seem'd all on fire within, around, | Deep sacristy and altar's pale; | Shone every pillar foliage-bound, | And glimmer'd all the dead men's mail' (canto VI, stanza XXIII, lines 33-40). The chapel, a 15th-century building located 9 miles south of Edinburgh, is also described in Scott's Provincial Antiquities & Picturesque Scenery of Scotland (1826) and is thought to have provided the model for the convent of Engaddi in The Talisman (1825). Its architecture inspired the rich moulded ceiling of the library at Scott's home of Abbotsford. According to tradition the 'Prentice Pillar' was carved by an apprentice while the master mason was studying in Rome. Upon his return, the master mason struck the apprentice dead with his mallet in a fit of jealousy. Lawson, J.P. Scotland Delineated: In a Series of Views by Clarkson Stanfield. London: J.

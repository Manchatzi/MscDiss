George Hamilton-Gordon, Earl of Aberdeen, K. T.-F. A. S. &c &c. Steel engraved portrait of George Hamilton Gordon, Earl of Aberdeen, by T. Woolnoth after a painting by A. Wivell Portrait of the British statesman George Hamilton Gordon, Earl of Aberdeen (1784-1860). The Conservative diplomat and statesman George Hamilton-Gordon, 4th Earl of Aberdeen, served successively as British Ambassador to Austria (1813-14), Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster (1828), Foreign Secretary (1828-30 and 1841-46), Secretary of State for War and the Colonies (1834-35), and Prime Minister (1852-55). Scott first met him as a guest of Lord Abercorn in 1807, judging him 'a very accomplishd young man who promises to make a figure' (letter to Lady Scott, 30 March 1807). Lord Aberdeen subsequently secured a diplomatic position for Scott's son Charles (1830) and furnished his son Walter with a letter of introduction to the British Ambassador to France. The original portrait by Wivell was painted in the mid-1820s. The National Portrait Gallery of Illustrations and Eminent Personages. London: Fisher, Son & Co., 1846

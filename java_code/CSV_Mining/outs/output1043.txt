Henry Mackenzie: From the Original in Possession of the Publishers Engraved portrait of Henry Mackenzie by S. Freeman after J. Watson Gordon Engraved portrait of Scottish novelist Henry Mackenzie (1745-1831). Scott read Henry Mackenzie's novels in his youth and became his friend and colleague in adulthood.Mackenzie contributed to Walter Scott's Edinburgh Annual Register and both men were trustees of the Edinburgh Theatre. In 1823, Scott edited Mackenzie's fiction for Ballantyne's Novelists Library, and provided a biographical sketch of the author which was subsequently reprinted as one of his Lives of the Novelists. The original portrait by Watson Gordon was probably expressly painted to be engraved by Freeman for Chambers's Biographical Dictionary of Eminent Scotsmen (1835). It may have derived from an earlier portrait by Watson Gordon painted during Mackenzie's lifetime. Chambers, R. (ed.) A Biographical Dictionary of Eminent Scotsmen, vol. III. Glasgow: Blackie, 1835

Nidpath Castle and Peebles Engraving of Neidpath Castle by W. Richardson after D.O. Hill Depicts the River Tweed, Scottish Borders, with Neidpath Castle and Peebles in the background. Sir Walter Scott's poem, 'The Maid of Neidpath', was published in William Whyte's A Collection of Scottish Airs (1806-07): 'Disease had been in Mary's bower | And slow decay from mourning, | Though now she sits on Neidpath's tower | To watch her Love's returning' (lines 5-8). Neidpath, near Peebles, is a 14th-century castle converted into a 17th-century tower house. At the turn of the 19th century, it was home to Scott's close friend Adam Ferguson. Neidpath Castle has also been suggested as the model for Saint Ronan's Castle as described in chapter I of Saint Ronan's Well (1823). Hogg, J. Tales and Sketches by the Ettrick Shepherd. Vol. II.

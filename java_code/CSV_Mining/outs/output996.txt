[Engraving of Inveraray by W. Forrest after W. L. Leitch]  Depicts the town of Inveraray (Argyll and Bute) and Loch Fyne. In ch. 12 of Sir Walter Scott's A Legend of Montrose (1819), Sir Duncan Campbell and Captain Dalgetty arrive in Inveraray (formerly Inverary), ancestral home of the Marquis of Argyle. The village is described as 'a rude assemblage of huts, with a very few stone mansions interspersed, stretching upwards from the banks of Loch Fine to the principal gate of the castle'. Extensively rebuilt in 1745, by Scott's age it had become 'a neat country town'. There are further references to Inverary as the seat of the Duke of Argyll in The Heart of Mid-Lothian (1818). The original steel engraving was made for the Abbotsford Edition of the Waverley Novels (1842-1847). Scott, W. A Legend of Montrose. Edinburgh: Adam and Charles Black, [185-?]   Inveraray

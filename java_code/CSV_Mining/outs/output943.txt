View From the Summit of Goatfell, Island of Arran Lithograph of Goatfell on the Isle of Arran by T. Picken after J. D. Harding Presents a view from Goatfell across the Isle of Arran. In Canto IV of Sir Walter Scott's The Lord of the Isles (1815) Robert the Bruce sets sail for Arran where his forces are to assemble: 'Now launched once more, the inland sea | They furrow with fair augury, | And steer for Arran's isle; | The sun, ere yet he sunk behind | Ben-Ghoil, "the Mountain of the Wind," | Gave his grim peaks a greeting kind, | And bade Loch Ranza smile.' (stanza 12, lines 1-7). Ben Ghoil is the Gaelic name for Goatfell. Scott had himself visited Arran in September 1814 when he joined a party of Commissioners for the Northern Lighthouse Service on a voyage of inspection around the coast of Scotland. Arran is also described in chapter 41 of The Heart of Midlothian (1818) as abounding 'with the grandest and most romantic scenery'. Lawson, J.P.

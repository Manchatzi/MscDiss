Francis Jeffrey: One of the Lords of Session Engraved portrait of Francis Jeffrey by G. Stodart after G. Hayter Engraved profile portrait of the Scottish lawyer and critic Francis Jeffrey, Lord Jeffrey (1773-1850). Francis Jeffrey was one of the founders of the Edinburgh Review and responsible for asking his fellow advocate Walter Scott to contribute. The Review flourished with Jeffrey as editor, and he became a powerful and influential critic. Jeffrey reviewed a number of Scott's own works making few concessions to personal friendship. Scott was particularly hurt by his critique of Marmion (1808), feeling that it might have been couched 'in language rather more civil to a personal friend'. While entertaining the highest regard for Jeffrey's talents, Scott felt he lacked 'the taste for poetry which is essentially necessary to enjoy and of course to criticize it with justice', and specifically 'that enthusiastic feeling which like sun-shine upon a landscape lights up every beauty and palliates if it cannot hide ever defect' (letter to Joanna Baillie, 31 October 1808).

Heart of Midlothian: Taken Down 1817 Engraving of St. Giles' Cathedral and Tolbooth by W. Forrest after D. Wilson Depicts the Tolbooth outside St. Giles' Cathedral, Edinburgh. The Old Tolbooth, a prison in Edinburgh's High Street nicknamed 'The Heart of Midlothian', features prominently in Sir Walter Scott's novel of that name, published in 1818. Although the Tolbooth was demolished in 1817, its former entrance is marked by a heart-shaped pattern of stones in the pavement by St. Giles' Cathedral. Following the demolition, the Tolbooth's doorway, door, and lock were incorporated into Scott's house of Abbotsford. Wilson, D. Memorials of Edinburgh in the Olden Time. Vol. I. Edinburgh: A. and C.

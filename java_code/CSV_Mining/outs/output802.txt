Mr. Leslie Engraved portrait Sir John Leslie by J. G. Lockhart Engraved profile portrait of Scottish mathematician and physicist Sir John Leslie (1766-1832) at a podium. In 1808 Sir Walter Scott engaged Leslie, Professor of Mathematics at Edinburgh University, to contribute scientific articles to the Edinburgh Annual Register. Writing to George Ellis, Scott described Leslie as 'a great philosopher, and as abominable an animal as I ever saw', adding that 'he writes, however, with great eloquence, and is an enthusiast in mathematical, chemical, and mineralogical pursuits' (13 December 1808). The original artist is J. G. Lockhart using the pseudonym W. Wastle, a character in his Peter's Letters to his Kinfolk. Lockhart may also be the engraver. Lockhart, J. G. Peter's Letters to His Kinsfolk, vol. I. Edinburgh: William Blackwood, 1819 (facing p. 64)

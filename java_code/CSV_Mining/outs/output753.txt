The Bear Gates, Traquair House Facsimile of a pencil drawing of the Bear Gates, Traquair House by G. Home Depicts the closed Bear Gates of Traquair House, Scottish Borders. Traquair House, near Peebles, parts of which date from the twelfth century, is considered to be the oldest continually inhabited house in Scotland. It was one of Walter Scott's favourite haunts and has been suggested as a model for the castles of Tully-Veolan in Waverley (1814) and Ellieslaw in The Black Dwarf (1816). In particular, the recurring bear motif at Tully-Veolan is thought to have been suggested by the Bear Gates of Traquair. According to tradition, the Bear Gates have been closed ever since the 5th Earl of Traquair bid farewell to Prince Charles Edward Stuart and swore that the gates would not re-open until the Stuart monarchy was restored.

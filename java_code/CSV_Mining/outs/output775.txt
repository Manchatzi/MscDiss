The Author of 'Elia' Facsimile reproduction of a print portrait of Charles Lamb by Daniel Maclise Sketch of English essayist Charles Lamb (1775-1834) at his desk, with facsimile of signature. Walter Scott met the essayist Charles Lamb in the London studio of the painter Benjamin Robert Haydon in March 1821. Scott later contributed to Charles Lamb's fundraising efforts for William Godwin, and issued an invitation for Lamb to visit should he ever be in Scotland, 'though I have not forgotten his metropolitan preference of houses to rocks, and citizens to wild rustics and highland men' (Letter to Benjamin Robert Haydon, October 1822). Lamb replied on 29 October 1822, saying that he would be delighted to take up Scott's offer in the unlikely event of his ever visiting Scotland. This facsimile reproduction is of one of a series of portraits originally published in Fraser's Magazine, 1830-1838, under the title 'A Gallery of Illustrious Literary Characters'. Maclise, D. The Maclise Portrait Gallery of Illustrious Literary Characters, ed. W. Bates. London: Chatto and Windus, 1883 (facing p. 148)

Peel Castle, Lancashire Coloured engraving of Peel Castle by W. Daniell Depicts boats on the Irish Sea with Peel Castle (Isle of Man) and St. Patrick's Isle in the middle distance. Peel Castle, or Holm-Peel, Isle of Man, figures prominently in Sir Walter Scott's Peveril of the Peak (1823) as the residence of the Countess of Derby. It is described in chapter 15 of the novel as 'one of those extraordinary monuments of antiquity with which this singular and interesting island abounds'. Scott did not personally visit the Isle of Man, but received information from his younger brother Thomas who served as an officer in the Manx Fencibles from 1808 to 1810. The image is both drawn and engraved by William Daniell. Ayton, R. A Voyage Round Great Britain. London: Longman, Hurst, Rees, Orme, and Brown, 1814-25   Peel Castle

Lucy Ashton Steel engraving by H. Robinson after a drawing by W. Etty of a character from Scott's novel The Bride of Lammermoor Three-quarter portrait of Lucy Ashton, as described in The Bride of Lammermoor, ch. 3. Illustrates the text: 'Lucy Ashton's exquisitely beautiful, yet somewhat girlish features, were formed to express peace of mind, serenity, and indifference to the tinsel of worldly pleasure. Her locks, which were of shadowy gold, divided on a brow of exquisite whiteness, like a gleam of broken and pallid sunshine upon a hill of snow.'

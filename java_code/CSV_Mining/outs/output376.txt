Count Robert of Paris Frontispiece engraving by W. Greatbatch after a drawing by W. Boxall of a scene from Scott's novel Count Robert of Paris Depicts Count Robert seated on the throne of Emperor Alexius during the oath-taking ceremony on the eve of the Crusade (Count Robert of Paris, ch. 9). Illustrates the lines: 'Without a moment's hesitation the Frank seated himself in the vacant throne of the Emperor, and extending his half-armed and robust figure on the golden cushions which were destined for Alexius, he indolently began to caress a large wolf-hound.' This engraving was originally made for the Magnum Opus edition of Count Robert of Paris, published by Robert Cadell, Edinburgh, in 1833. The engraver's name is variously spelt 'Greatbatch' or 'Greatbach'. Most reference sources favour the latter spelling. Scott, W. Count Robert of Paris. Edinburgh: Adam and Charles Black, 1879, vol. 1 (front.)    Crusades- First, 1096-1099

Melrose Abbey: From the South East Engraving of Melrose Abbey by J. Johnstone after J. Bower Depicts the ruins of Melrose Abbey, Scottish Borders, taken from the south-east. Sir Walter Scott coordinated the restoration of Melrose Abbey in 1822. The Abbey features in many of Scott's works, most famously The Lay of the Last Minstrel (1805): 'If thou would'st view fair Melrose aright, | Go visit it by the pale moonlight [...] | Then view St. David's ruin'd pile; | And, home returning, soothly swear, | Was never scene so sad and fair!' (canto II, stanza I, lines 1-2, 16-18). The religious house of Kennaquhair in The Monastery and The Abbot (both 1820) is also based on the Abbey, and it is described in detail in Scott's 'Essay on Border Antiquities' (1814). The engraving was taken from an 1832 drawing by John Bower.    Melrose Abbey

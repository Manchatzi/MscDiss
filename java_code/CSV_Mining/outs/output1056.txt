Hermione Engraved portrait by W.H. Mote after E.T. Parris of a character from Scott's novel Anne of Geierstein Engraved portrait of Hermione, a character in Scott's Anne of Geierstein (1829). This portrait of Hermione, a learned Persian woman who acts as tutor to the Baron of Arnheim in Anne of Geierstein, was inspired by the following passage in ch. 11 of the novel: 'The silver lamp was extinguished, or removed from its pedestal, where stood in place of it a most beautiful female figure in the Persian costume, in which the color of pink predominated. But she wore no turban or head-dress of any kind, saving a blue ribbon drawn through her auburn hair, and secured by a gold clasp, the outer side of which was ornamented by a superb opal [...]. The little lady's countenance was of a lively and expressive character, in which spirit and wit seemed to predominate; and the quick dark eye, with its beautifully formed eyebrow, seemed to presage the arch remark, to which the rosy and half smiling lip appeared ready to give utterance.'

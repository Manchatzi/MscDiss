Braxfield Engraved portrait of Robert Macqueen, Lord Braxfield by W. H. Lizars after H. Raeburn Engraved half-length portrait of Robert Macqueen, Lord Braxfield (1722-1799) in his judicial robes. When the young Sir Walter Scott's family moved to George Square, Edinburgh, in 1774, one of their neighbours was Robert Macqueen, Lord Braxfield, Lord Justice Clerk and a judge of notorious severity. When studying for the Bar, Scott politically dedicated his thesis to Braxfield, a move which paid off when Braxfield found the young advocate work at the circuit court at Jedburgh. This portrait was engraved by William Home Lizars, son of Daniel Lizars. Although Daniel Lizars died in 1812, the family occasionally continued to use W&D Lizars as their signature. Lockhart, J. G.

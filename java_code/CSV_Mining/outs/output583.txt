Scott's Favourite View: The Eildons and the Tweed from above Bemersyde Facsimile of a pencil drawing of the Eildon Hills by G. Home Presents a view of the River Tweed, the Tweed Valley, and the Eildon Hills from Bemersyde Hill near Melrose, Scottish Borders. According to popular tradition, Sir Walter Scott so favoured this view and paused there so frequently on his way home to Abbotsford, that his horses eventually learned to stop without command. They are reputed to have stopped at the viewpoint even when drawing Scott's funeral carriage en route for Dryburgh Abbey in 1832. Baikie, J. The Charm of the Scott Country. London: A. & C.

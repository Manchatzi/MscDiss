[Engraving of the Vale of Gala Water by W. Forrest after C. Stanfield]  Depicts the Vale of Gala Water from the woods of Abbotsford, Scottish Borders. The Gala Water, a tributary of the River Tweed, runs through the heart of the 'Scott Country'. In his Memoirs of the Life of Sir Walter Scott, Bart. (1837-1838), Scott's son-in-law J. G. Lockhart describes the return of the dying Scott to Abbotsford on 11 July 1832 after a lengthy stay on the Continent. Scott begins to revive from a state of torpor as his carriage descends the Vale of Gala, and he murmurs, 'Gala Water, surely -- Buckholm --Torwoodlee'. The original steel engraving was made for the Abbotsford Edition of the Waverley Novels (1842-1847), where it appeared as an illustration to The Monastery. Scott, W. The Monastery.

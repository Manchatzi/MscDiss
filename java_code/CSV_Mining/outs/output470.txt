Mr. Clerk Engraved portrait of John Clerk by J. Stewart Engraved portraits of Scottish judge John Clerk, Lord Eldin (1757-1832). Clerk was a colleague of Sir Walter Scott at the Scottish Bar and was appointed to the Bench as Lord Eldin in 1823. He was known as a great connoisseur and collector of art. Scott consulted him as to the authenticity of a painting purporting to show the head of Mary Queen of Scots following her execution (see letter to Robert Pitcairn, 18 September 1822). Eldin was also a fellow antiquarian and co-member of the Bannatyne Club. Lord Eldin's father, Sir John Clerk of Eldin, provided some of the inspiration for the antiquarian Jonathan Oldbuck in Scott's The Antiquary (1816) and owned Lasswade Cottage where Scott lived between 1798 and 1803. Lord Eldin's younger brother William, another advocate, was an intimate friend of Scott's. The initials P.M. on the plate stand for Peter Morris, the pseudonym that Lockhart adopted when writing Peter's Letters to His Kinsfolk (1819). In a letter to Lockhart of 23 March 1819 Scott particularly praised his character sketch of Lord Eldin. Lockhart, J. G. Peter's Letters to his Kinsfolk. 3rd ed, vol II.

Joanna Baillie Steel engraved portrait of Joanna Baillie by H. Robinson after a painting by Masquerier Engraved portrait of the Scottish poet and dramatist Joanna Baillie (1762-1851). Sir Walter Scott was a great admirer of Joanna Baillie's blank verse Plays of the Passions, considering her 'the best dramatic writer whom Britain has produced since the days of Shakespeare and Massinger' (letter to Sarah Smith, 4 March 1808). He was first introduced to her at her Hampstead home in 1806, and the pair became lifelong friends and devoted correspondents. Scott found her 'the only writing lady with whose manners in society I have been very much delighted' (letter to Lady Abercorn, 18 September 1811). As a Trustee of Edinburgh Theatre, Scott played an active role in organizing a highly successful production of Baillie's The Family Legend and a revival of her De Montfort in 1810. Scott's own drama Halidon Hill began life as a contribution to Joanna Baillie's Collection of Poetical Miscellanies. When it grew too large for the anthology, it was replaced by a shorter dramatic sketch MacDuff's Cross. Baillie had earlier contributed verse to Scott's anthology English Minstrelsy (1810). The original portrait by Masquerier was painted in 1812. Concerning it, Scott wrote to Richard Heber: 'How has your friend Masquerier succeeded in painting Miss Baillie? if tolerably I must manage to get a copy cabinet size but poor M. has a heavey [sic] hand.'

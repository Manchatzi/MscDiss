Boccaccio: From a Print by Cornelius Van Dalen Steel engraved portrait of Boccaccio by W. Hopwood after a print by C. Van Dalen Engraved portrait of the Italian writer Giovanni Boccaccio (1313-1375). The Decameron of Giovanni Boccaccio was a lifelong favourite of Sir Walter Scott and is frequently cited in the Waverley Novels. While a college student, Scott took private Italian lessons to be able to read Ariosto, Tasso, Boccaccio, and Boiardo in the original. He gave Edward Waverley, hero of his first novel (1814), much of his own love of Italian literature. The 17th-print by Van Dalen was taken from a portrait in the Royal Collection which is now attributed to Titian. It is now thought that the sitter is not Boccaccio but Jacopo Sannazaro.

Admiral Blake: From the Picture in the Hall of Wadham College, Oxford Steel engraved portrait of Robert Blake by J. Mollison Engraved portrait of Admiral Robert Blake (1599-1657). Robert Blake was appointed General at Sea by Cromwell in 1649 and is often described as the Father of the Royal Navy. In Sir Walter Scott's Peveril of the Peak (1823), the Countess of Derby recalls his unsuccessful siege of Peel Castle on the Isle of Man: 'When we had foiled various attempts upon the island by open force -- treason accomplished what Blake and Lawson, with their floating castles, had found too hazardous an enterprise -- a base rebel, whom we had nursed in our own bosoms, betrayed us to the enemy.' (ch. 5) The engraving by Mollison is taken after a 17th-century portrait by an unknown artist. The Portrait Gallery of Distinguished Poets, vol. II. London: Wm. S. Orr & Co., 1853

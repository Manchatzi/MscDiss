Canova: From a Picture by Sir Thomas Lawrence in the Possession of the Abate Canova at Rome Steel engraved portrait of Canova by J. Posselwhite after a painting by T. Lawrence Engraved portrait of the Italian sculptor Antonio Canova (1757-1822). Like most of his contemporaries, Sir Walter Scott considered Canova the foremost sculptor of his age. Visiting Paris in 1815, he admired the three Canovas commissioned by the Empress Josephine for the Malmaison (now in the Hermitage, St Petersburg). His Paul's Letters to his Kinsfolk (1816) records that he was 'particularly struck' by the Dancer with her Hand on her Hip. When in Rome in April 1832, the dying Scott most wished to see Canova's Cenotaph of the Stuarts erected in St Peter's at the expense of George IV. The following month he admired Canova's Venere Italica in the Palazzo Pitti in Florence. He also mentioned Canova's Venus Victrix in his Life of Napoleon Buonaparte (1827-28), commenting that Pauline Bonaparte's 'encouragement of the fine arts was so little limited by the ordinary ideas of decorum' that she permitted the sculptor to use her as the model. There is a single reference to Canova in the Waverly Novels. In chapter 12 of Saint Ronan's Well (1824) Valentine Bulmer declares that Clare Mowbray's pallor renders her more interesting: 'The last time I saw her, I thought she might have rivalled one of Canova's finest statues.' The original portrait by Sir Thomas Lawrence was painted in 1816. The Portrait Gallery of Distinguished Poets, vol. III. London: Wm. S. Orr & Co., 1853 Italy Paris

Drake: From an Original Picture in the Possession of Sir T. F. Eliot Drake Bart. of Nutwell Court near Exeter Steel engraved portrait of Sir Francis Drake by W. Holl Engraved portrait of the English sailor Sir Francis Drake (1540?-1596). In a footnote to chapter 7 of the Magnum Opus edition of Kenilworth (1831), Scott writes that 'Sir Francis Drake, Morgan, and many a bold buccaneer of those days, were, in fact, little better than pirates'. Indeed, in The Pirate (1821) Bunce laments that pirates can no longer achieve respectability whereas 'Old Drake, in Queen Bess's time, could plunder Peru and Mexico without a line of commission to shew for it, and blessed be her memory, he was knighted for it on his return' (vol, III, ch. 4). In the same novel, tales of Drake tempt Mordaunt Mertoun to join Captain Cleveland's pirate crew (I, 9). The Portrait Gallery of Distinguished Poets, vol. I. London: Wm. S. Orr & Co., 1853

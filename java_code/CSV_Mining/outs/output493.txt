Elizabeth: From the Picture in His Majesty's Collection at St. James's Palace Steel engraved portrait of Queen Elizabeth I by W. Holl after I. Oliver Engraved portrait of Elizabeth I, Queen of England (1533-1603). The plot of Sir Walter Scott's novel Kenilworth (1821) centres around the ill-fated secret marriage of Queen Elizabeth I's favourite, the Earl of Leicester to Amy Robsart. Elizabeth figures prominently in the novel, particularly during the celebrations held in her honour at Kenilworth Castle. Elizabeth also features as a supporter of the Protestant cause in Scotland in The Monastery and The Abbot (1820). Her relations with Mary Queen of Scots are discussed in the latter novel and, at length, in Tales of a Grandfather, Second Series (1829). The engraving is probably derived from a portrait by Isaac Oliver. The Portrait Gallery of Distinguished Poets, vol. I. London: Wm. S. Orr & Co., 1853

[Walter Scott]: Etched by W. Mayor after a Sketch by Edwin Landseer Facsimile of etched portrait of Walter Scott by W. Mayor after E. Landseer Facsimile of etched profile portrait of Walter Scott. The etching by W. Mayor was taken from a portrait now in the collection of the Dower House Gallery, Boughton House. According to Algernon Graves, the portrait was painted in 1831 (Catalogue of the Works of the Late Sir Edwin Landseer, no. 163). There is no record of Scott sitting for Landseer in that year, but Scott appears markedly older than in sketches made by Landseer in 1824. Francis Russell agrees that it is 'not unreasonable' to suggest that Landseer may have seen Scott in 1831, but argues that Landseer nonetheless referred to his earlier sketches of Scott (Portraits of Sir Walter Scott, no. 113). The etching by Mayor was published in 1832.

Robert Southey, Esqr., Poet Laureate Engraved portrait of Robert Southey by R. Page after H. Edridge Engraved portrait of English poet Robert Southey (1774-1843), with decorative border. Scott and Southey first met when Southey visited him at Ashestiel in August 1805. Later in the same month, Scott visited Southey at Keswick, and subsequently made further visits in 1813 and 1825. Southey contributed to a number of Scott's literary projects, including An Apology for Tales of Terror (1799), his English Minstrelsy (1810), the Quarterly Review, and the Edinburgh Annual Register. Scott made repeated attempts to secure a salary for the impecunious Southey. Finally when Scott was offered the position of Poet Laureate in 1813, he declined and instead recommended Southey. The original drawing of Robert Southey by Henry Edridge was made in 1804.

Shakspere [sic]: From the Picture in the Possession of His Grace the Duke of Buckingham, at Stowe Engraved portrait of William Shakespeare by E. Scriven after J. Taylor Engraved portrait of English playwright William Shakespeare (1564-1616). Scott steeped himself in Shakespeare's plays from his earliest youth, and his works abound in allusions to and quotations from them. Shakespeare appears as a character in chapter 17 of Kenilworth (perhaps, with Rokeby, Scott's most Shakespearian work) and is warmly praised by Queen Elizabeth I. A bust of Shakespeare occupies pride of place in Scott's library at Abbotsford. A long-cherished project to publish a popular edition of Shakespeare never came to fruition. The original portrait of William Shakespeare is attributed to John Taylor and is dated c. 1610. The Portrait Gallery of Distinguished Poets, vol. I. London: Wm. S. Orr & Co., 1853

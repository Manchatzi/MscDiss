Sir Henry Raeburn Engraving by G. B. Shaw of a self-portrait by Sir Henry Raeburn Engraved self-portrait of Scottish artist, Sir Henry Raeburn (1756-1823). Raeburn, the most celebrated Scottish portraitist of his day, painted four likenesses of Sir Walter Scott: for Archibald Constable in 1808, for Scott himself in 1809, for Lord Montagu, and for Raeburn's own private gallery (both 1823). Scott disliked the first two portraits, lamenting that Raeburn had 'twice made a very chowderheaded [i.e. clumsy- or thick-headed] person of me' (letter to Duke of Buccleuch and Queensberry, 15 April 1819). On Raeburn's death, Scott wrote that 'painting is deprived of a votary of genius, our city of an ornament, and society of a most excellent and most innocent member' (letter to Benjamin Robert Haydon, 8 July 1823). The original self-portrait by Henry Raeburn was painted in 1815. Chambers, R. (ed.) A Biographical Dictionary of Eminent Scotsmen. Glasgow: Blackie, 1835

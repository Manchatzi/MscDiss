Rosslyn (or Roslin) Castle is featured in Sir Walter Scott's Lay of the Last Minstrel (1805) in the ballad of 'Rosabelle' recited by the bard Harold: 'O'er Roslin all that dreary night, | A wondrous blaze was seen to gleam; | 'Twas broader than the watch-fire's light, | And redder than the bright moon-beam' (canto VI, stanza XXIII, lines 25-28). The castle, a ruined 14th-century building located 9 miles south of Edinburgh, is also described in Scott's Provincial Antiquities & Picturesque Scenery of Scotland (1826). Hogg, J.

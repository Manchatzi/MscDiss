His Roy. Highs. Henry Frederick, Late Duke of Cumberland Engraved portrait of Henry Frederick, Duke of Cumberland by J. J. Jenkins after a painting by J. Reynolds Engraved vignette portrait of Henry Frederick, Duke of Cumberland (1745-1790). Henry Frederick, Duke of Cumberland and Strathearn, was the sixth child of Frederick, Prince of Wales and Augusta of Saxe-Gotha, and a younger brother of George III. He acceded to the Duchy in 1766, following the death of Prince William Augustus, known as 'Butcher Cumberland' for his persecution of the Jacobites following their defeat at Culloden. Sir Walter Scott portrays William Augustus in Waverley (1814) and Redgauntlet (1824). There appears to be no mention, however, of Henry Frederick in Scott's writings, although Scott's son Walter served under his successor Prince Ernest Augustus, Duke of Cumberland and Teviotdale.

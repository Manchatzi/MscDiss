John Wilson Esq., Professor of Moral Philosophy Engraved portrait of John Wilson by J. Horsburgh after R. Lauder Engraved portrait of John Wilson (1785-1854), Scottish poet, essayist, and Professor of Moral Philosophy at Edinburgh University. Along with Scott's son-in-law and biographer J. G. Lockhart and James Hogg, John Wilson was the principal contributor to the satirical Blackwood's Magazine. Scott considered him 'very clever but somewhat whimsical' (letter to Mrs Clephane, 3 December 1818) and thought him a doubtful influence on J.G. Lockhart as he disputed 'with low adversaries' and indulged in biting, personal attacks (letter to Lady Louisa Stuart, 13 April 1826). Scott successfully canvassed for Wilson in his campaign to be elected Professor of Moral Philosophy at Edinburgh University (1820). Scott hoped that the position would give Wilson 'the consistence and steadiness which is all he wants to make him the first man of the age' (letter to J.G. Lockhart, 30 March 1820). The original portrait by Robert Scott Lauder was exhibited in 1832. The engraving was probably made before 1850 when John Horsburgh scaled down his professional activities.

[Engraved portrait of Sir Walter Scott by H.W. Smith after Sir T. Lawrence]  Portrait of Sir Walter Scott at the age of fifty-five including a facsimile signature. Scott first sat for the original portrait by Sir Thomas Lawrence in March 1821 (not 1820). Further sittings followed in November 1826, but the painting was not ready for delivery until November 1828. Commissioned by George IV, it is part of the collection at Windsor Castle. A version of this engraving by Hezekiah Wright Smith was published in James F. Hunnewell's The Lands of Scott (Edinburgh: A. & C. Black; Boston: James R. Osgood, 1871).

Sir Walter Scott's Burial Place, Dryburgh Abbey Engraving of St. Mary's Aisle, Dryburgh Abbey by W. H. Lizars Depicts a pair of young children at St. Mary's Aisle, Dryburgh Abbey, Scottish Borders. Sir Walter Scott was interred in St. Mary's Aisle on September 26, 1832. Scott lamented in his 'Autobiography' (1808) that, though his ancestors, the Haliburtons, once owned the Abbey, 'we have nothing left of Dryburgh... but the right of stretching our bones.' Scott's wife, Margaret Charlotte Carpenter, his eldest son, Walter Scott, and his son-in-law and biographer, J.G. Lockhart, are also buried here. The engraving was made by W.H. Lizars from his own design. Morton, J. The Monastic Annals of Teviotdale. Edinburgh: W.H. Lizars, 1832   Dryburgh Abbey

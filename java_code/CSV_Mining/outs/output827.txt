Bothwell Castle Lithograph of the ruins of Bothwell Castle by E. Walker after S. Prout Depicts the ruins of the South-East Tower of Bothwell Castle, South Lanarkshire. In ch. 37 of Scott's Old Mortality (1816), Henry Morton passes the 'romantic ruins of Bothwell Castle' as he revisits the scene of the Covenanters' defeat at the Battle of Bothwell Bridge (1679). Scott had first visited the castle, a 13th-century edifice located southeast of Glasgow, in 1799 when visiting Lord and Lady Douglas. He was inspired to write the unfinished ballad 'Bothwell Castle'. On a later visit he wrote the ballad of 'Young Lochinvar' which he published as part of Marmion (1808). Lawson, J.P. Scotland Delineated: In a Series of Views by Clarkson Stanfield. London: J.

Bentley: From a Picture by Hudson in Trinity College, Cambridge Steel engraved portrait of Richard Bentley by J. Posselwhite after a painting by Hudson Engraved portrait of the critic and classical scholar Richard Bentley (1662-1742). In Sir Walter Scott's novel Waverley (1814), the protagonist Edward Waverley is portrayed as a conceited, unreceptive scholar: '"I can read and understand a Latin author," said young Edward, with the self-confidence and rash reasoning of fifteen, "and Scaliger or Bentley could not do much more."' (ch. 3) Richard Bentley is perhaps England's greatest classical scholar. In his Memoir of Jonathan Swift (1814), Scott discusses Bentley's role in the controversy sparked by Sir William Temple's Ancient and Modern Learning which Swift satirized in The Battle of the Books (1704).

Loch Vennachoir (Perthshire): Looking South West Engraving of Loch Vennachar by J. Swan after J. Fleming Depicts Loch Vennachar, Perthshire, and surrounding countryside. Loch Vennachar, Perthshire, figures prominently in both Marmion (1808) and The Lady of the Lake (1810). In canto V of the latter, the wounded Roderick Dhu is carried on horseback from the shores of Loch Vennachar to Stirling Castle. In September 1809, Scott made the same ride himself to verify whether it was possible in the time he planned to allot to it in the poem. Leighton, J.M. The Lakes of Scotland: A Series of Views.

Thomas the Rhymer's Tower, Earlston Facsimile of a pencil drawing of the Rhymer's Tower by G. Home Depicts the Rhymer's Tower in Earlston, Berwickshire, with fields of wheat in the foreground. The Rhymer's Tower is traditionally considered to have been the home of poet and prophet, Thomas the Rhymer. Sir Walter Scott included the ballad of Thomas the Rhymer in the second volume of his Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border (1802), adding a 'Third Part' of his own composition. Scott also believed Thomas to be the author of 'Sir Tristrem', which he edited for publication in 1804. Baikie, J. The Charm of the Scott Country. London: A. & C. Black, 1927.

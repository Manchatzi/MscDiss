Dobbs Linn, Moffatdale Engraving of Dobbs Linn by W. Forrest after D.O. Hill An image of Dobbs Linn, near Moffat, Dumfriesshire, depicting a ravine with a waterfall cascading into a pool. A young girl, Katharine Laidlaw, is indicating the entrance to a hidden cave. Dobbs Linn was used as hiding-place by the Covenanters during the 'Killing Times'. The Linn and its surroundings influenced the geography of Sir Walter Scott's Tale of Old Mortality. ('Linn' can mean either a cascade, the pool into which a cascade falls, or a ravine.) The original painting by David Octavius Hill was made expressly for the 1837 edition of Tales and Sketches by the Ettrick Shepherd [i.e. James Hogg]. It illustrated a scene from 'The Brownie of Bodsbeck' where Katharine, daughter of the hero Walter Laidlaw, leads him to a hidden cave in the Linn. Hogg, J.

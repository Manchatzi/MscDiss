De Foe: From a Print by M. Vandergucht Steel engraving of Defoe by J. Thomson after a print by M. van der Gucht Engraved portrait of the English author Daniel Defoe (1661?-1731). According to John Robert Moore, it was Sir Walter Scott 'more than any other individual [...] who raised Defoe from obscurity in literary history to his modern position as a master of prose fiction' ('Defoe and Scott', PMLA, 56 (1941), 710-35). Scott edited the first collection of Defoe's novels for the Ballantyne Press (1809-10) and assembled many of his anonymous tracts in his edition of the Somers Tracts (1809-15). For Miscellaneous Prose Works of Sir Walter Scott (1827), Scott added extensive critical remarks to the biographical sketch co-written with John Ballantyne that preceded his edition of Defoe's novels. This influential essay ascribed Defoe's appeal to 'the unequalled dexterity with which our author has given an appearance of REALITY to the incidents which he narrates'. Defoe's influence on Scott has been observed particularly in Old Mortality (1816), Rob Roy (1817), and The Pirate (1821). The engraving is derived from a 1703 print by Michael Vandergucht (1660-1725) itself engraved from a painting by Jeremiah Taylor (fl. 1700-50). The Portrait Gallery of Distinguished Poets, vol. II.

Palace of Linlithgow Engraving of Linlithgow Palace by W.H. Lizars after J.B. Kidd Depicts Linlithgow Palace, West Lothian, beside the shore of Linlithgow Loch. Linlithgow Palace was built in the eleventh century and was a royal residence from the twelfth to the late sixteenth century. It was accidentally gutted by fire in 1746. In Marmion (1808), Sir Walter Scott describes Linlithgow as: 'Of all the palaces so fair, | Built for the royal dwelling, | In Scotland, far beyond compare | Linlithgow is excelling;' (canto IV, stanza XV, lines 1-4). The Palace is more fully described in Scott's Provincial Antiquities & Picturesque Scenery of Scotland (1826) and features in a number of his other works, notably Waverley (1814) and Tales of a Grandfather (1828-1830). The entrance porch at Scott's home of Abbotsford was modelled after that of Linlithgow Palace. Chambers, R. The Picture of Scotland. Vol. II. Edinburgh: W.

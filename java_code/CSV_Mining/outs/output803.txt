Schiller: From a Print by Faustin Anderloni, after a Picture by G. von Kugelgen Engraved portrait of Friedrich Schiller by J. Posselwhite after F. Anderloni after G. von Kugelgen Engraved profile portrait of German author Friedrich Schiller (1759-1805). Beginning in 1792, Walter Scott enthusiastically read the works of Goethe and Schiller with a group of friends at Edinburgh University. Inspired by Alexander Fraser Tytler's translation of Schiller's drama Die RÌ_uber, Scott prepared his own version of Schiller's Die VerschwÌ¦rung des Fiesco zu Genoa. The manuscript is now lost but Scott recalled that he 'used to read it to sobbing and weeping audiences & no wonder, for whatever may be thought of the translation the original is sublime' (letter to Mary Anne Hughes, 13 December 1821). Scott also wrote a play The House of Aspen in imitation of Schiller, which he later dismissed as 'a sort of half-mad German tragedy which I wrote many years ago when my taste was very green and when like the rest of the world I was taken in with the bombast of Schiller' (letter to Lady Abercorn, 17 May 1811). Although he distanced himself from his early love of German theatre, it is widely thought to have exerted a profound influence on his conception of the historical novel. The original portrait by Gerhard von Kugelgen was probably painted in 1808 or 1809. Posselwhite's engraving is derived from an earlier engraving by Faustino Anderloni.

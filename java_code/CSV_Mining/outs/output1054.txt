Fenella Engraved portrait by H. Cook after H. Howard of a character from Scott's novel Peveril of the Peak Engraved portrait of Fenella, confidante of the Countess of Derby in Sir Walter Scott's Peveril of the Peak (1823). This portrait is inspired by a passage in ch. 5 of the novel. Fenella, who has assumed the role of a deaf mute, attempts to warn Julian Peveril against keeping a rendezvous with Alice Bridgenorth: 'She proceeded to put him to the question by a series of gestures, which we will endeavour to describe. She commenced by extending her hand slightly, accompanied with the sharp inquisitive look which served her as a note of interrogation... Fenella looked grave, shook her head, and pointed to the Countess's window, which was visible from the spot where they stood.' Portraits of the Principal Female Characters in the Waverley Novels.

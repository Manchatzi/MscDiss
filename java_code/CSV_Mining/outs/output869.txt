The Back of old Leith Pier Lithograph of Leith Pier by T. Picken after C. Stanfield Depicts Leith Pier, Edinburgh, with people gathered around a boat on the shore. According to his friend James Skene of Rubislaw, Scott frequently walked to Leith Pier, 'to which the freshness of the sea breeze offered a strong inducement to those accustomed to pass a few of the morning hours within the close and impure atmosphere of the Court of Session' (quoted in The Journal of Sir Walter Scott (Edinburgh: David Douglas, 1890), I, 210, n. 1). Scott gave a description and historical account of Leith harbour in Provincial Antiquities & Picturesque Scenery of Scotland (1826). Leith Pier features in Waverley (1814), ch. 56, where Edward Waverley obtains permission for his prisoner Colonel Talbot to sail from there to England, and in Old Mortality (1816), ch. 36, where Henry Morton sails into European exile from Leith. Scott himself sailed from Leith on 29 July 1814 when he accompanied the Commissioners for the Northern Lighthouse Service on a voyage of inspection. Lawson, J.P.

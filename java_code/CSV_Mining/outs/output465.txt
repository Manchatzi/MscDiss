Sir Wm. Chambers Engraved portrait of Sir William Chambers by W. Bromley after F. Cotes Engraved portrait of the British architect Sir William Chambers (1723-1796). Chambers is best known as the architect of Somerset House, London (1776-96). Reviewing James Boaden's Memoirs of the Life of John Philip Kemble for the Quarterly Review in June 1826, Sir Walter Scott recalled an incident at the Annual Dinner of the Royal Academy in Somerset House, which he had attended with Kemble. At the height of the meal, a massive chandelier had become partially dislodged, and disaster had been narrowly averted: 'If the absolute fall of the chandelier had taken place, it would have tried Chambers's architecture with a vengeance, and beyond a doubt must have penetrated through the floor to the very cellars of the building, carrying with it princes, dukes, painters, poets, musicians, amateurs -- and critics.' The original portrait was painted in 1764 by Francis Cotes. European Magazine. London: J. Sewell, 1796 London Somerset House

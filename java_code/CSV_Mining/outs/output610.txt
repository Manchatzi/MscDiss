Elvet Bridge, Durham Engraving of Elvet Bridge, Durham by E. Francis after W. Westall Depicts the Elvet Bridge with Durham Castle in the background. The city of Durham features in a number of Scott's works, most notably Harold the Dauntless: 'Grey towers of Durham!... | Well yet I love thy mix'd and massive piles, | Half church of God, half castle 'gainst the Scot,' (canto III, pt. 1, lines 1,10-11). Jeannie Deans passes through Durham on her way to London in The Heart of Midlothian (ch. 27), and it also mentioned as the resting place of St Cuthbert in Marmion: 'There, deep in Durham's Gothic shade, | His relics are in secret laid' (canto II, stanza 14, lines 27-28).

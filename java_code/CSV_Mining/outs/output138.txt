Rebecca Steel engraving by J. Cochran after a drawing by S. A. Hart of a character from Scott's novel Ivanhoe Depicts Rebecca at the tournament at Ashby-de-la-Zouch, Leicestershire (Ivanhoe, ch. 7). Illustrates the following text: 'Her turban of yellow silk suited well with the darkness of her complexion. The brilliancy of her eyes, the superb arch of her eyebrows, her well-formed aquiline nose, her teeth as white as pearl, and the profusion of her sable tresses [...] fell down upon as much of a lovely neck and bosom as a simarre of the richest Persian silk [...] permitted to be visible.'

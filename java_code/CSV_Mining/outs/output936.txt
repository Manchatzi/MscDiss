Edinburgh: From the Calton Hill Lithograph of Edinburgh from Calton Hill by T. Picken after D. Roberts Depicts a view of Edinburgh city centre from Calton Hill as it was in the 1840s. In the middle ground may be seen the recently completed Scott Monument. Sir Walter Scott was born and raised in Edinburgh and worked there, first as an Advocate from 1792 to 1806, then as Clerk of the Court of Session until his retirement in 1830. The city features in many of his works, most notably The Heart of Mid-Lothian (1818). In Provincial Antiquities & Picturesque Scenery of Scotland (1826), Sir Walter Scott describes the view from Calton Hill 'where every passenger, however much accustomed to the wonderful scene, is inclined to pause, and, with eyes unsatisfied with seeing, to gaze on the mingled and almost tumultuous scene which lies before and beneath him'.

The Cross, Melrose, Roxburghshire Engraving of the Cross, Melrose by J. Greig after L. Clennell Depicts the Cross in Market Square, Melrose, Scottish Borders. Sir Walter Scott's home of Abbotsford lay only a few miles west of the town of Melrose in the Scottish Borders. Melrose is set in the heart of the 'Scott Country', and is featured in many of his works, most notably The Lay of the Last Minstrel (1805) and, under the guise of 'Kennaquhair', in The Monastery and The Abbot (both 1820). Town and abbey are described in detail in Scott's 'Essay on Border Antiquities' (1814). At a vital moment in The Monastery, ch. 37, the Earl of Murray meets the Abbot of Kennaqhair beneath the 'mercat cross' in the town's marketplace to demand that he hand over Sir Piercie Shafton.

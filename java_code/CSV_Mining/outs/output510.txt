Gustavus Adolphus: From a Print by Paul Pontius after a Picture by Van Dyck Steel engraved portrait of Gustavus Adolphus by J. Posselwhite after a painting by Van Dyck Engraved portrait of Gustavus Adolphus, King of Sweden (1594-1632). Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden achieved renown as a military commander during the Thirty Years War (1618-48) with the aid of a brigade of Scottish mercenaries. In Sir Walter Scott's A Legend of Montrose (1819), the soldier of fortune Captain Dalgetty refers constantly to his service under 'that invincible monarch, the bulwark of the Protestant faith, the Lion of the North, the terror of Austria, Gustavus the Victorious' (ch. 2). Captain Dalgetty's horse Gustavus is named in honour of his former commander. In Old Mortality (1816), Henry Morton considers taking up arms abroad: 'Perhaps some lucky chance may raise me to a rank with our Ruthvens, our Lesleys, our Monroes, the chosen leaders of the famous Protestant champion, Gustavus Adolphus' (ch. 6). Gustavus Adolphus's Scottish brigade is also discussed in Tales of a Grandfather, Second Series (1829). The Portrait Gallery of Distinguished Poets, vol. I. London: Wm. S. Orr & Co., 1853

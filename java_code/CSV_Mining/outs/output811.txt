Madame de StaÌÇl: From the Original Picture by F. GÌ©rard, in the Possession of M. de Broglie, at Paris Engraved portrait of Madame de StaÌÇl by E. Scriven after F. GÌ©rard Engraved half-length portrait of French-Swiss author Madame de StaÌÇl (1766-1817). When Madame de StaÌÇl was rumoured to be planning a visit to Edinburgh in 1814, Scott wrote that he would be 'both curious and pleased' to see a woman of her 'literary reputation' (letter to Sarah Smith, 8 January). Should, however, the visit be cancelled, he would not altogether regret it 'for as I tired of some of her works, I am afraid I should disgrace my taste by tiring of the authoress too' (letter to Joanna Baillie, 10 December 1813). Scott drew on Madame de StaÌÇl's Memoirs when preparing his Life of Napoleon Bonaparte (1827-1828). The original portrait by FranÌ¤ois GÌ©rard was painted in 1818.

Buffon: From an Original Picture by Drouais in the Collection of the Institute of France Steel engraved portrait of Buffon by R. Hart after a picture by Drouais Engraved portrait of the French naturalist Georges Louis Leclerc, comte de Buffon (1707-1788). Sir Walter Scott's library at Abbotsford included an edition of Buffon's Histoire naturelle, g̩n̩rale et particuli̬re. Scott drew on it when likening the painter Dick Tinto to a sloth in chapter 1 of The Bride of Lammermoor (1819): 'In short, Dick Tinto's friends feared that he had acted like the animal called the sloth, which, heaving eaten up the last green leaf upon the tree where it has established itself, ends by tumbling down from the top, and dying of inanition.' The original portrait by Fran̤ois Hubert Drouais was painted in 1761. The Portrait Gallery of Distinguished Poets, vol. II. London: Wm. S. Orr & Co., 1853

Stirling Castle Lithograph of Stirling Castle by T. Picken after G. F. Robson Depicts a regiment of soldiers patrolling the area around Stirling Castle. The concluding scenes of Sir Walter Scott's The Lady of the Lake (1810) take place in 'the bulwark of the North, | Grey Stirling, with her towers and town' (canto V, stanza XVIII, lines 34-35). The castle features in a number of Scott's works, most notably Waverley, ch. 38, where the Jacobites guarding Edward Waverley exchange fire with the castle's garrison. The stained glass portraits of Scottish kings in the armoury window at Scott's home of Abbotsford are based on carvings in the presence chamber of Stirling Castle. Lawson, J.P.

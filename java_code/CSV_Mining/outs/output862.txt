Glen Falloch Lithograph of Glen Falloch by T. Picken after G.F. Robson Depicts Glen Falloch with the River Falloch running into Loch Lomond. While researching Rob Roy (1817), Walter Scott visited Glen Falloch at the head of Loch Lomond. It is mentioned in ch. 29 of the novel as a sure place of refuge for Rob Roy Macgregor as it belongs to his wife's relatives. Glen Falloch has also been identified with the 'gloomy and desolate' spot, haunted by a spirit known as the 'Cloght-dearg', where the clergyman Mr Tyrie meets Elspat MacTavish Mhor in The Highland Widow (1827). The original drawing by G. F. Robson was probably taken expressly for Scotland Delineated. Lawson, J.P. Scotland Delineated: In a Series of Views by Clarkson Stanfield. London: J.

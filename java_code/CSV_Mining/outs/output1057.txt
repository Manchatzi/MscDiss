Isabelle de Croye Engraved portrait by H. Robinson after S.J. Rochard of the heroine of Scott's novel Quentin Durward Engraved profile portrait of Countess Isabelle de Croye, heroine of Scott's Quentin Durward (1823). This portrait of Isabelle de Croye is inspired by the eponymous hero's first glimpse of her: 'He speedily made the discovery that a quantity of long black tresses, which, in the maiden fashion of his own country, were unadorned by any ornament, except a single chaplet lightly woven out of ivy leaves, formed a veil around a countenance which, in its regular features, dark eyes, and pensive expression, resembled that of Melpomene, though there was a faint glow on the cheek, and an intelligence on the lips and in the eye, which made it seem that gaiety was not foreign to a countenance so expressive, although it might not be its most habitual expression.'

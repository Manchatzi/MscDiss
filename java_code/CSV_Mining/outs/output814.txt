James Watt: From a Picture by Sir W. Beechey in the Possession of J. Watt Esq. of Aston Hall Engraved portrait of James Watt by C.E. Wagstaff after W. Beechey Engraved seated portrait of Scottish engineer James Watt (1736-1819). In the preface to The Monastery, Scott saluted Watt as 'the man whose genius discovered the means of multiplying our national resources to a degree perhaps even beyond his own stupendous powers of calculation and combination; bringing the treasures of the abyss to the summit of the earth--giving the feeble arm of man the momentum of an Afrite--commanding manufactures to arise, as the rod of the prophet produced water in the desert--affording the means of dispensing with that time and tide which wait for no man, and of sailing without that wind which defied the commands and threats of Xerxes himself'. He was, furthermore, 'one of the best and kindest of human beings'. Scott presided at a meeting, at the Waterloo Hotel, Edinburgh, to raise subscriptions for a monument to Watt on 9 July 1824. The original portrait of Watt by Sir William Beechey was painted in 1801. The Portrait Gallery of Distinguished Poets, vol. III. London: Wm. S. Orr & Co., 1853

Jeannie Deans Steel engraving by W. H. Mote after a drawing by C. R. Leslie of a character from Scott's novel The Heart of Midlothian Depicts Jeanie Deans in a tartan head-dress as she is presented to the Duke of Argyle (Heart of Midlothian, ch. 34). Illustrates the text: 'She wore the tartan plaid of her country, adjusted so as partly to cover her head, and partly to fall back over her shoulders. A quantity of fair hair, disposed with great simplicity and neatness, appeared in front of her round and good-humoured face, to which the solemnity of her errand gave an appearance of deep awe.'

The Editor of 'Blackwood's Magazine' Facsimile reproduction of a print portrait of John Wilson by Daniel Maclise Facsimile of sketch of John Wilson (1785-1854), Scottish poet, essayist, and Professor of Moral Philosophy at Edinburgh University, with facsimile of his signature. Along with Scott's son-in-law and biographer J. G. Lockhart and James Hogg, John Wilson was the principal contributor to the satirical Blackwood's Magazine. Scott considered him 'very clever but somewhat whimsical' (letter to Mrs Clephane, 3 December 1818) and thought him a doubtful influence on J.G. Lockhart as he disputed 'with low adversaries' and indulged in biting, personal attacks (letter to Lady Louisa Stuart, 13 April 1826). Scott successfully canvassed for Wilson in his campaign to be elected Professor of Moral Philosophy at Edinburgh University (1820). Scott hoped that the position would give Wilson 'the consistence and steadiness which is all he wants to make him the first man of the age' (letter to J.G. Lockhart, 30 March 1820). This facsimile reproduction is of one of a series of portraits originally published in Fraser's Magazine, 1830-1838, under the title 'A Gallery of Illustrious Literary Characters'. Maclise, D. The Maclise Portrait Gallery of Illustrious Literary Characters, ed. W. Bates. London: Chatto and Windus, 1883 (facing p. 32)

Sir Humphrey Davy: From the Original Picture by Sir Thomas Lawrence, in the Possession of the Royal Society Steel engraving of Sir Humphry Davy by E. Scriven after a painting by T. Lawrence Engraved portrait of the British scientist, inventor, and poet Sir Humphry Davy (1778-1829). Sir Walter Scott and Davy were fellow guests of William Wordsworth's at Dove Cottage, Grasemere, in August 1805. Scott 'liked him excessively' and was 'particularly delighted with the total absence of pedantry which has always appeared to me the test of true genius' (letter to Jane Kerr Apreece, 2 April 1811). Davy later made two visits to Scott at Abbotsford in 1820 and 1823. In 1812 Davy had become a member of Scott's extended family by marrying his widowed cousin Jane Kerr Apreece. As a favour to her Scott wrote a review of Davy's Salmoniana for the Quarterly Review in 1828. The original portrait by Sir Thomas Lawrence was painted ca. 1821.

Lord Rodney: From a Picture by Sir Joshua Reynolds in His Majesty's Collection at St. James's Palace Engraved portrait of Baron George Brydges Rodney by E. Scriven after J. Reynolds Engraved portrait of Admiral Lord Rodney (1718-1792) wearing the riband and star of the Order of the Bath. Sir Walter Scott's older brother Robert served as a midshipman under Lord Rodney in a number of naval engagements against the French in the West Indies. In his unfinished Autobiography (1808), Scott quotes from an elegy by Robert on the imagined loss of his ship written on the eve of Rodney's victory in the Battle of the Saintes (April 9-12, 1782). In a footnote to the Magnum Opus edition of The Pirate (1831), Scott reveals that Captain Cleveland's tales of the haunted isles of the Caribbean (ch. 22) derive from stories told by his brother. The original portrait by Sir Joshua Reynolds was painted in 1789. The Portrait Gallery of Distinguished Poets, vol. III. London: Wm. S. Orr & Co., 1853

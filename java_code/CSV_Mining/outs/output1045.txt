Dugald Stewart Esq. Engraved portrait of Dugald Stewart by S. Freeman after H. Raeburn Engraved half-length portrait of Scottish philosopher Dugald Stewart (1753-1828). Sir Walter Scott studied Moral Philosophy under Dugald Stewart at Edinburgh University in 1789-90. An exponent of the Scottish 'Common Sense' School of philosophy, Stewart greatly influenced Scott's views on history, human nature, and political ethics. At one stage good friends, the two men fell out following Scott's vehement support of Henry Dundas, Viscount Melville when he was impeached in 1806 for misappropriation of public money. The original portrait by Sir Henry Raeburn was painted ca. 1810. Chambers, R. (ed.) A Biographical Dictionary of Eminent Scotsmen. Vol. IV. Glasgow: Blackie. 1835.

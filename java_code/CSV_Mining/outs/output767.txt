Baron Hume, 1756-1838 Facsimile of a portrait of Baron Hume by H. Raeburn Black and white facsimile of a portrait of David Hume (1757-1838) as Baron of the Exchequer. Walter Scott enjoyed the University lectures of his Scots Law professor, David Hume (nephew and heir to the philosopher of the same name). In his unfinished 'Autobiography' (1808), Scott praised Hume's 'penetration and clearness of conception' and hailed him as an 'architect' to the law of Scotland. In 1811, Scott and Hume were rival candidates for the post of Principal Clerk to the Court of Session. Hume was offered the post and irritated Scott by vacillating for some time before accepting. Nonetheless, Hume remained a valued friend and colleague and was one of the first to guess the identity of the 'Author of Waverley'. The original portrait by Raeburn was commissioned by the Society of Writers to Her Majesty's Signet in 1822. It remains part of the Society's collection.

Dryburgh Abbey: The Tomb of Sir Walter Scott Facsimile of a painting of Sir Walter Scott's burial place at Dryburgh Abbey by E.W. Haslehust Depicts St Mary's Aisle, Dryburgh Abbey, Scottish Borders, the burial place of Sir Walter Scott. Sir Walter Scott was interred in St. Mary's Aisle on September 26, 1832. Scott lamented in his 'Autobiography' that, though his ancestors, the Haliburtons, once owned the Abbey, 'we have nothing left of Dryburgh... but the right of stretching our bones.' Scott's wife, Margaret Charlotte Carpenter, his eldest son, Walter Scott, and his son-in-law and biographer, J.G. Lockhart, are also buried here. Geddie, J. The Scott Country.

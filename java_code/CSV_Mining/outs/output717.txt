Melrose Abbey Engraving by T. Higham after G. Cattermole of a scene from Scott's novel The Abbot Depicts Magdalen and Roland Graeme visiting Melrose Abbey, Scottish Borders, after it has been sacked by the Reformers (The Abbot, ch. 8). Kennaquhair Abbey in Scott's novels The Monastery and The Abbot (both 1820) is generally thought to be based on Melrose Abbey. This engraving illustrates a scene from chapter 13 of The Abbot: 'Magdalen and Roland remained alone in that great vaulted space... and in the pell-mell havoc, the tombs of warriors and of princes had been included in the demolition of the idolatrous shrines. Lances and swords of antique size, which had hung over the tombs of mighty warriors of former days, lay now strewed among relics.' The engraving was first published in the first edition of Leitch Ritchie's Scott and Scotland (1835). Stevens, H.I. & A. Scott and Scotland, or, Historical and Romantic Illustrations of Scottish Story. London: H.I. & A. Stevens, 1845 (facing p.107)   Melrose Abbey

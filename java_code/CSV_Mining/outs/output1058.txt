Sir John Leslie: Professor of Natural Philosophy in the University of Edinburgh Engraved portrait of Sir John Leslie by J. Johnstone after B.W. Crombie Engraved profile portrait of Scottish mathematician, scientist, and prolific inventor Sir John Leslie (1766ха1832). In 1808 Sir Walter Scott engaged Sir John Leslie, Professor of Mathematics at Edinburgh University, to contribute scientific articles to the Edinburgh Annual Register. Writing to George Ellis, Scott described Leslie as 'a great philosopher, and as abominable an animal as I ever saw', adding that 'he writes, however, with great eloquence, and is an enthusiast in mathematical, chemical, and mineralogical pursuits' (13 December 1808). The original portrait by Benjamin W. Crosbie was probably made for his Modern Athenians (1831), a collection of caricature etchings of prominent Edinburgh citizens. Chambers, R. (ed.)

Charles V: From the Original by Holbein in the Private Collection of the King of the French Steel engraved portrait of Charles V by W. Holl after a painting by Holbein Engraved portrait of Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor (1500-1558). When, in chapter 6 of Sir Walter Scott's Guy Mannering (1815) Counsellor Pleydell abdicates the role of monarch in the game of High Jinks, he declares: 'Nay, then, sink state and perish sovereignty! for, like a second Charles V, we will abdicate, and seek in the private shades of life those pleasures which are denied to a throne.' In 1556 Charles V abdicated the thrones of the Holy Roman Empire, Spain, Naples, Sicily, the Burgundian Netherlands, and the Spanish colonies in America. Dividing his realms between his son Philip and his brother Ferdinand, he retired to a monastery. According to Scott's The Life of Napoleon Buonaparte (1827-28), the French Emperor also likened his own abdication to that of Charles V. The Portrait Gallery of Distinguished Poets, vol. I.

National Monument, Calton Hill Lithograph of the National Monument, Calton Hill, Edinburgh by T. Picken after J.D. Harding Depicts the National Monument on Calton Hill, Edinburgh. The National Monument was built between 1824 and 1829 in memory of those who had died in the Napoleonic Wars. It was modelled on the Parthenon in Athens, but only the faÌ¤ade was completed. It is generally believed that funding ran out, but surviving drawings by the architects C. R. Cockerell and William Playfair suggest that no building had been projected beyond the extant structure. Scott wrote approvingly of Playfair's plans in a letter to Robert Johnston, 19 September 1819. Scott described Calton Hill in Provincial Antiquities & Picturesque Scenery of Scotland (1826), but made no reference to the National Monument. Lawson, J.P.

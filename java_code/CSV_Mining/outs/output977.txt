Bishop's Palace at Gloucester Engraved title page and frontispiece of Scott's The Betrothed Title page of The Betrothed, volume XXXVII of a set of the Waverley Novels published by A. & C. Black, depicting the Bishop's Palace, Gloucester. In ch. 18 of Sir Walter Scott's The Betrothed (1825), Hugo de Lacy meets Baldwin, Archbishop of Canterbury, in the Bishop's Palace at Gloucester. Scott is guilty here of an anachronism. There was no Diocese of Gloucester in the twelfth century, the period in which the novel is set. The fourteenth-century building portrayed here only became the Bishop's Palace in 1542 when Henry VIII created the Diocese. Previously it had been the residence of the Abbot of the Benedictine Abbey of St. Peter. The original wood engraving, probably by J. J. Field, was made for the Abbotsford Edition of the Waverley Novels (1842-1847). Scott, W. The Betrothed. Edinburgh: Adam and Charles Black, [185-?] Bishop's Palace Gloucester

Erasmus: From the Original Picture by G. Penn in his Majesty's Collection at Windsor Steel engraved portrait of Erasmus by E. Scriven after G. Pencz after H. Holbein the Younger Engraved portrait of the Dutch humanist Erasmus (d. 1536). There are a number of references to and borrowings from Erasmus in Sir Walter Scott's works. In The Antiquary (1815), Jonathan Oldbuck's German ancestor Aldobrand has conversed with Erasmus (ch. 11). In Kenilworth (1821), the pedantic schoolmaster Erasmus Holiday derives his name 'partly from his father having been the son of a renowned washerwoman, who had held that great scholar in clean linen all the while he was at Oxford' and partly due to 'the secret presentiment of his mother's mind that, in the babe to be christened, was a hidden genius, which should one day lead him to rival the fame of the great scholar of Amsterdam' (ch. 9). In Anne of Geierstein (1829), the description of a German tavern and of 15th-century Germany manners is derived, without acknowledgment, from Erasmus's dialogue Diversoria (ch. 19). There is a further quotation from Diversoria in chapter 1 of Saint Ronan's Well (1823). The engraving by Scriven is taken from a portrait by Georg Pencz which is itself, however, an enlargement of a portrait by Hans Holbein the Younger. The Portrait Gallery of Distinguished Poets, vol.

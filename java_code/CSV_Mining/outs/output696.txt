Melrose from the East: The Tweed in the Foreground Facsimile of a pencil drawing of Melrose by G. Home Depicts a view of the Melrose countryside, Scottish Borders, with the River Tweed in the foreground. Sir Walter Scott's home of Abbotsford lay only a few miles west of the town of Melrose in the Scottish Borders. Melrose is set in the heart of the 'Scott Country', and is featured in many of his works, most notably The Lay of the Last Minstrel (1805) and, under the guise of 'Kennaquhair', in The Monastery and The Abbot (both 1820). Town and abbey are described in detail in Scott's 'Essay on Border Antiquities' (1814). Baikie, J. The Charm of the Scott Country. London: A. & C. Black, 1927 (facing p.67)   Melrose

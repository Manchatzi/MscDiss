Arkwright: From a Picture by Wright of Derby Steel engraved portrait of Sir Richard Arkwright by J. Posselwhite after a picture by Wright of Derby Engraved portrait of the English engineer and industrialist Sir Richard Arkwright (1732-1792). Frances Crawford Kemble Arkwright set a number of Scott's lyrics to music, including 'Farewell to the Muse' (from The Pirate) and 'The Lay of Poor Louise' (from The Fair Maid of Perth). Scott described her as 'the most beautiful composer and delightful singer I ever heard without exception' (letter to Major Walter Scott, 20 May 1830). Scott was under the impression that she was the daughter-in-law of Sir Richard Arkwright, inventor of the spinning frame. In point of fact, her husband was Sir Richard's grandson Robert. Her father was the actor Stephen Kemble, brother of the better-known Charles Kemble, John Philip Kemble, and Sarah Kemble (later Mrs Siddons). The original portrait of Arkwright was painted in 1789-90 by Joseph Wright of Derby (or, at least, was produced by his studio). The Portrait Gallery of Distinguished Poets, vol. I. London: Wm. S. Orr & Co., 1853

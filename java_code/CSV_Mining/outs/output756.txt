Pourbus Engraved portrait of Henri IV, King of France (1553-1610). In ch. 22 of Sir Walter Scott's novel Woodstock (1826), the heroine Alice Lee hopes that the exiled Charles II will unite all the kingly virtues of his grandfather Henri IV of France: his 'chivalrous courage', 'warlike skill', 'all his benevolence, love of his people, patience even of unpleasing advice, sacrifice of his own wishes and pleasures to the commonweal'. While in Paris in 1815, Walter Scott spent time in the King's Library reading letters of Henri IV to his mistress Gabrielle d'Estr̩es. The original portrait by Frans Pourbus the Younger was painted between 1605 and 1610. The Portrait Gallery of Distinguished Poets. Vol. I. London: Wm. S. Orr & Co, 1853   Paris

Frederick II: From the original by Carlo Vanloo in the private collection of the King of the French Steel engraved portrait of Frederick II of Prussia by E. Scriven from a picture by Carlo Vanloo Engraved portrait of Frederick II ('the Great'), King of Prussia (1712-1786). In Munich in May 1832, Sir Walter Scott admired the coat, pistols, saddle and bridle of Frederick the Great. He had earlier advised his soldier son Walter to read Frederick's instructions to light troops as 'he was the first who reduced that important part of an army to system and principle' (letter of 27 June 1820). In his Life of Napoleon Buonaparte (1827-28), Scott describes the King of Prussia and Tsar of Russia swearing to liberate Germany on Frederick the Great's tomb. In Paul's Letters to His Kinsfolk (1815), he unfavourably compares Napoleon who plundered the artistic treasures of Dresden with Frederick who was content to admire them.

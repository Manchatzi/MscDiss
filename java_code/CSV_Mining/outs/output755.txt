[Facsimile of a painting of Yarrow by Thomas Scott]  Depicts a seated woman with dog in the Yarrow countryside, Scottish Borders. The Yarrow Valley (or Yarrowdale) was one of the favourite haunts of Walter Scott and fertile ground for gathering songs for his Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border (1802-03). The district is particularly celebrated in The Lay of the Last Minstrel (1805), where the aging minstrel sings: 'By Yarrow's stream still let me stray, | Though none should guide my feeble way' (canto VI, stanza II, lines 14-15).

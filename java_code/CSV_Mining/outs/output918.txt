Sir Walter Scott Bart. Engraved portrait of Sir Walter Scott by an unknown artist, possibly after J. W. Gordon Portrait of Sir Walter Scott at the age of fifty-eight, with a book in his left hand. The head and shoulders of Sir Walter Scott in this engraving are very similar to those in the portrait that John Watson Gordon painted for Robert Cadell in 1830. However, in Gordon's portrait, Scott is shown with a walking cane and his dog Bran, whereas here he is portrayed with a book. According to Francis Russell in his Portraits of Sir Walter Scott: A Study of Romantic Portraiture (1987), p. 41, unsigned derivations of Watson Gordon's portrait were issued by J. Lofts, by Harwood, and by L. Tallis.

Roslyn Chapel, S. East End Engraving of Roslin Chapel by an unattributed artist Depicts the interior of the south-east end of Rosslyn Chapel, Midlothian. Rosslyn (or Roslin) Chapel is featured in Sir Walter Scott's Lay of the Last Minstrel (1805) in the ballad of 'Rosabelle' recited by the bard Harold: 'Seem'd all on fire that chapel proud, | Where Roslin's chiefs uncoffin'd lie... | Seem'd all on fire within, around, | Deep sacristy and altar's pale; | Shone every pillar foliage-bound, | And glimmer'd all the dead men's mail' (canto VI, stanza XXIII, lines 33-40). The chapel, a 15th-century building located 9 miles south of Edinburgh, is also described in Scott's Provincial Antiquities & Picturesque Scenery of Scotland (1826) and is thought to have provided the model for the convent of Engaddi in The Talisman (1825). Its architecture inspired the rich moulded ceiling of the library at Scott's home of Abbotsford. Chambers, R. The Picture of Scotland. Vol. II. Edinburgh: W.

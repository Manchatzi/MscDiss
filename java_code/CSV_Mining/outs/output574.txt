Mr. Scott Engraved portrait of Sir Walter Scott by W. H. Lizars after H. Raeburn Three-quarter length portrait of Sir Walter Scott at the age of thirty-six. In his Portraits of Sir Walter Scott (1987), Frances Russell treats this engraving as a derivation of the portrait painted by Raeburn for Archibald Constable in spring 1808 (p. 74). In unpublished research James C. Corson argues that it was more probably derived from a second portrait by Raeburn, painted in 1809. and now on display at Abbotsford. The portrait was copied by J. G. Lockhart. The initials P.M. on the plate stand for Peter Morris, the pseudonym that Lockhart adopted when writing Peter's Letters to His Kinsfolk (1819), the publication for which this engraving was made. The engraver was William Home Lizars, son of Daniel Lizars. Although Daniel Lizars died in 1812, the family occasionally continued to use W. & D. Lizars as a collective signature. Lockhart, J.G.

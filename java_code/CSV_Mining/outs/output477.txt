Cortez: From a Picture in the Florence Gallery Steel engraved portrait of Cortes by W. Holl Engraved portrait of HernÌÁn CortÌ©s (1485-1547), conqueror of Mexico. In Letters on Demonology and Witchcraft (1830), Scott cites an episode in the life of the conquistador HernÌÁn CortÌ©s (or CortÌ©z) as an instance of the 'infectious character of superstition'. According to Bernal Dií?az del Castillo's Historia verdadera de la Nueva EspaníÄa, CortÌ©s did not himself see a vision of Saint Iago on a white horse which appeared to his soldiers and urged them on to a victory against great odds. Instead he saw a cavalier, named Francisco de Morla, mounted on a chestnut horse. Rather than concluding, however, that the vision was a figment of the collective imagination, CortÌ©s exclaimed: 'Sinner that I am, what am I that I should have beheld the blessed apostle!' There are further references to CortÌ©s in Rokeby (1813) and The Pirate (1821). In canto I, stanza 12 of the former Bertram Risingham describes the Battle of Marston Moor. If he had led such valiant men, he exclaims, he would not have sought 'El Dorados in the sky' but would have outstripped the conquests of CortÌ©s and Pizarro (lines 19-28). In chapter 4 of The Pirate, Scott remarks that the Scottish plough that Triptolemus Yellowly seeks attempts to introduce to Shetland would seem stranger to a modern Scottish farmer 'than the corslets and casques of the soldiers of Cortes might seem to a regiment of our soldiers'. The engraving is taken after a portrait by an unknown artist in the Galleria degli Uffizi, Florence. The Portrait Gallery of Distinguished Poets, vol. I. London: Wm. S. Orr & Co., 1853

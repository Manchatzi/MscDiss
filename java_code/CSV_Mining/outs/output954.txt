Archbishop Sharpe Engraved title page and frontispiece of Scott's Old Mortality Title page of Old Mortality, volume X of a set of the Waverley Novels published by A. & C. Black, depicting James Sharp, Archbishop of St Andrews (1613-1679). In ch. 5-6 of Sir Walter Scott's Old Mortality (1816), the hero Henry Morton shelters John Burley of Balfour who is wanted for his part in the assassination of James Sharp, Archbishop of St Andrews (3 May 1679). Sharp was detested by the Covenanters for betraying the Presbyterian cause and playing a major role in the reintroduction of Episcopacy and oppression of the Covenanting party. In Tales of a Grandfather, Second Series (1829), Scott wrote of Sharp: 'He had some virtues, being learned, temperate, and living a life becoming his station; but his illiberal and intolerant principles, and the violences which he committed to enforce them, were the cause of great distress to Scotland, and of his own premature and bloody end.' The Dickes portrait of Archbishop Sharp is based on a 17th-century portrait by Sir Peter Lely. The wood engraving was originally made for the Abbotsford Edition of the Waverley Novels (1842-1847).

Dunbar Castle Engraving of Dunbar Castle by E. Goodall after J. C. Schetky Depicts the ruins of Dunbar Castle, East Lothian, with a group of people in the foreground. Sir Walter Scott traced the history of Dunbar Castle in Provincial Antiquities and Picturesque Scenery of Scotland (1826). In his notes to 'Thomas the Rhymer' in Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border (1802), Scott discusses prophetic verses attributed to Thomas of Ercildoune concerning the heroic defence of Dunbar Castle (1337) by the Countess of March ('Black Agnes'). A further account of the siege is given in Tales of a Grandfather, First Series (1828). The original oil painting by John Christian Schetky, probably made specifically for Provincial Antiquities and Picturesque Scenery of Scotland, is displayed in Abbotsford. Scott, W.

Tasso: From a Print by Raffaelle Morghen Engraved portrait of Torquato Tasso by R. Hart after R. Morghen after P. Ermini Engraved portrait of Italian poet Torquato Tasso (1544-1595) crowned with laurels. As described in his unfinished Autobiography (1808), Sir Walter Scott first discovered Tasso's Gerusalemme Liberata while at school in Kelso (1783). At Edinburgh University (1786-1790), Scott took evening lessons in Italian in order to read Tasso, Ariosto, and other poets in the original. Edward Waverley, hero of Scott's first novel, shares his creator's love of Italian Romance. Hart's engraving is based on an earlier engraving by Raphael Morghen, which was taken from the original portrait by Pietro Ermini (op. 1799-1820). The Portrait Gallery of Distinguished Poets, vol. I.

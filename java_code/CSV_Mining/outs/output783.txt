[Facsimile reproduction of a self-portrait by Daniel Maclise]  Self-portrait of Irish artist Daniel Maclise (1806-1870) with facsimile of signature. During Sir Walter Scott's Irish tour of 1825, the young Daniel Maclise made a surreptitious sketch of the writer, which he subsequently made into a highly popular lithograph. The portrait of Scott was the foundation for a successful artistic career. Maclise moved to London and became celebrated as a portrait artist working primarily in pencil. This facsimile reproduction is of one of a series of portraits originally published in Fraser's Magazine, 1830-1838, under the title 'A Gallery of Illustrious Literary Characters'. Maclise, D. The Maclise Portrait Gallery of Illustrious Literary Characters, ed. W. Bates. London: Chatto and Windus, 1883 (facing p. 228)   Cork

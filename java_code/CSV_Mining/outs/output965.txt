Thomas Radcliffe, Earl of Essex Engraved title page and frontispiece of Scott's Kenilworth Title page of Kenilworth, volume XXIII of a set of the Waverley Novels published by A. & C. Black, depicting Thomas Radcliffe, 3rd Earl of Sussex (ca. 1525-1583). Thomas Radcliffe was Earl of Sussex, not Essex as indicated here. Under Queen Elizabeth, he served as Lord Lieutenant of Ireland (1559-1564) and Lord Chamberlain (1572-1583). His court rivalry with Robert Dudley, Earl of Leicester, forms the backdrop to Sir Walter Scott's Kenilworth (1821). Radcliffe wished Elizabeth to marry a non-English bridegroom and was thus hostile to Dudley's own ambitions to marry the Queen. The original wood engraving was made for the Abbotsford Edition of the Waverley Novels (1842-1847). It derives from a 16th-century painting by an unknown artist. Scott, W. Kenilworth. Edinburgh: Adam and Charles Black, [185-?]

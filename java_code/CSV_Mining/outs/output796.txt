Pope: From the Picture by Hudson, in the Possession of His Grace the Duke of Buckingham Engraved portrait of Alexander Pope by J. Posselwhite after W. Hoare Engraved portrait of English poet and satirist, Alexander Pope (1688-1744). In his unfinished Autobiography (1808), Scott recalls that, as a child of five or six, his 'hours of leisure were usually spent in reading aloud to my mother Pope's translation of Homer, which, excepting a few traditionary ballads, and the songs in Allan Ramsay's Evergreen, was the first poetry which I perused'. According to Lockhart, Scott called Pope a 'true deacon of the craft' and long cherished a plan to publish a complete edition and biography of Pope as he had done for Swift. The original portrait, made c. 1739-84, is by William Hoare rather than Thomas Hudson. The Portrait Gallery of Distinguished Poets, vol. II. London: Wm. S. Orr & Co., 1853

[Engraved portrait of Edmund Spenser by James Thomson after an unknown artist]  Engraved portrait of a man commonly identified as English poet Edmund Spenser (ca. 1552-1599). As Scott recorded in his unfinished Autobiography (1808), Edmund Spenser's The Fairie Queene was a childhood favourite. There are frequent allusions to and quotations from Spenser's allegory in Scott's fiction, and it provided a model for his poems The Vision of Don Roderick (1811) and The Bridal of Triermain (1813).

Mr. O Smith, as Christie of the Clint-hill, in the White Lady, Theatre Royal, Drury Lane Theatrical portrait of Mr O. Smith as Christie of Clint-hill in The White Lady Depicts actor O. Smith (1786-1855) in the role of Christie of the Clinthill for the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane. Richard John Smith, better known as O. Smith, specialized in villainous parts. Here he is portrayed in the role of Christie of the Clinthill in The White Lady, or, La Dame Blanche, a comic opera combining motifs from Sir Walter Scott's Guy Mannering (1815) and The Monastery (1820). With music by Fran̤ois Adrien Boieldieu (1775-1834) and libretto by Eug̬ne Scribe (1791-1861), it was first performed at the Op̩ra comique, Paris, on 10 December 1825. The first British production took place at Drury Lane on 9 October 1826, with additional music by Thomas Cooke (1782-1848), and a libretto by Samuel Beazley (1786-1851),which deviated drastically from Scribe's original and which followed Scott more closely. The character of Christie of the Clinthill, absent from the Scribe version, was, in fact, introduced by Beazley from Scott's The Monastery.

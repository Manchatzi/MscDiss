Colbert: From the Original by P. Mignard in the Collection of the Institute at Paris Steel engraved portrait of Colbert by W. Holl after a picture by Pierre Mignard Engraved portrait of the French statesman Jean Baptiste Colbert (1619-1683). Colbert served as Louis XIV's minister of finance from 1665 to 1683 and is credited with saving the nation from bankruptcy. In Tales of a Grandfather, Fourth Series (1831), Scott praises his tolerant attitude to France's Protestant minority. He argues that Colbert's death deprived the Protestants of a powerful protector, exposing them to the persecutions of the chancellor Michel le Tellier and his son Louvois, and leading directly to the Revocation of the Edict of Nantes (1685). The original portrait by Pierre Mignard was painted in 1667. The Portrait Gallery of Distinguished Poets, vol. II. London: Wm. S. Orr & Co., 1853

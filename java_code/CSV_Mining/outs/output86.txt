Guy Mannering Steel engraving by Lumb Stocks after a drawing by John Faed of a scene from Scott's novel Guy Mannering Depicts Godfrey Bertram seated before Ellangowan Castle, with Lucy Bertram, Charles Hazlewood, and Dominie Sampson (Guy Mannering, ch. 13). The picture illustrates the following words: 'Mr. Bertram, paralytic, and almost incapable of moving, occupiedhis easy-chair [...]. Behind him, with his hands crossed on the cane upon which he rested, stood Dominie Sampson, whom Mannering recognised at once. [...] On one side of the old man was a sylph-like form--a young woman of about seventeen [...] whom the Colonel accounted to be his daughter.' Scott, W. Guy Mannering.

Walter Scott, 1777, AEtat. 6 Engraved portrait of Sir Walter Scott as a child by J. Horsburgh from a copy of the original miniature Profile portrait of Sir Walter Scott at the age of four or five. The original 'Bath miniature' was painted by an anonymous artist during the young Scott's visit to Bath in 1775/76. Although the dates for this visit are uncertain, it is likely that Lockhart's dating (1777) is wrong, and that Scott was at most five years old at the time of the sitting. The miniature has been attributed to Abraham Daniel of Bath (d. 1806) by Sir John Pope-Hennessy (Francis Russell, Portraits of Sir Walter Scott, p. 36). The engraving is made from a copy of the miniature at Abbotsford which Lockhart erroneously believed to be the original. The original is held by the Society of Antiquaries. Lockhart, J.G.

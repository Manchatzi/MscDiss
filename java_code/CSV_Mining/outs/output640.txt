Fast Castle Engraving of Fast Castle by W. H. Lizars after J. Ewbank Depicts the ruins of Fast Castle near St Abbs Head, Berwickshire. Fast Castle has been identified as an inspiration for Wolf's Crag, the home of the Master of Ravenswood in Sir Walter Scott's The Bride of Lammermoor (1819). In the Magnum Opus edition of the novel (1830), Scott claims that he cannot comment on the perceived resemblance between Wolf's Crag and Fast Castle as he has only seen the latter from the sea. He acknowledges, however, that the position of Fast Castle resembles that of Wolf's Crag as much as any other fortalice on the East Coast of Scotland. Scott also describes the castle in Provincial Antiquities & Picturesque Scenery of Scotland (1826). Scott owned a painting of Fast Castle by the Rev. John Thomson (Letters, VIII, 459). Chambers, R.

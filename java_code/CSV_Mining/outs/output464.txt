Dr. Chalmers Engraved portrait of Thomas Chalmers by W. H. Lizars after J. G. Lockhart Engraved portrait of the Rev. Thomas Chalmers, founding father of the Free Church of Scotland. James Ballantyne records that Sir Walter Scott abandoned his habitual indifference to praise when he heard that his novels had been lauded in public by Chalmers. Scott declared that 'to have produced any effect upon the mind of such a man as Dr. Chalmers is indeed something to be proud of', for Chalmers was 'a man of the truest genius'. Only one encounter between Scott and Chalmers has been recorded. At the Annual Meeting of the School of Arts on 1 June 1824 Chalmers moved the approval of the Annual Report, expressing an essentially paternalistic vision of the relationship between the school and its working-class pupils. Scott seconded the motion, warmly applauding the principles underpinning Chalmers's speech. See William Hanna, Memoirs of the Life and Writings of Thomas Chalmers (New York: Harper, 1857), vol. III, pp. 37-38. The initials P.M. on the plate stand for Peter Morris, the pseudonym that Lockhart adopted when writing Peter's Letters to His Kinsfolk (1819). Lockhart, J. G. Peter's Letters to his Kinsfolk. 3rd ed, vol III. Edinburgh: William Blackwood, 1819

Whood Engraved portrait of the divine, mathematician, and classicist the Reverend Isaac Barrow (1630-1677). In his much-read treatise Self-Help, Samuel Smiles cited Sir Walter Scott and Isaac Barrow as twin examples of successful men dismissed as dunces at school. Both are praised not only for their perseverance but for their cultivation of physical fitness. In Smiles's wake, the coupling of Scott and Barrow became a staple of self-help manuals.

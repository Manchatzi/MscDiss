Dryburgh Abbey, Roxburghshire: (The Burial Place of Sir Walter Scott) Engraving of St Mary's Aisle, Dryburgh Abbey by J.C. Varrall after T. Allom Depicts the burial place of Sir Walter Scott in the ruins of Dryburgh Abbey, Scottish Borders. Sir Walter Scott was interred in St. Mary's Aisle, Dryburgh Abbey, on September 26, 1832. Scott lamented in his 'Autobiography' that, though his ancestors, the Haliburtons, once owned the Abbey, 'we have nothing left of Dryburgh... but the right of stretching our bones.' Scott's wife, Margaret Charlotte Carpenter, his eldest son, Walter Scott, and his son-in-law and biographer, J.G. Lockhart, are also buried here.

Dunfermline Abbey Lithograph of Dunfermline Abbey by T. Picken after D. O. Hill Depicts wooded parkland with Dunfermline Abbey, Fife, visible through the trees. In Tales of a Grandfather, First Series (1828), Sir Walter Scott describes how Robert the Bruce's heart was removed from his body in Dunfermline Abbey and taken to Melrose Abbey. He then describes how a skeleton, wrapped in rich cloth and with its heart removed, was discovered by workmen during restoration work on Dunfermline Abbey in 1819. Scott had a cast made from the skeleton's skull which he exhibited at Abbotsford. In 1822 the Magistrates of Dunfermline made a gift to Scott of panelling from a post-Reformation church built in the nave of Dunfermline Abbey. Lawson, J.P.

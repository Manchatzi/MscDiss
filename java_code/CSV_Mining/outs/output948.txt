Edinburgh Castle Engraved title page and frontispiece of Scott's Waverley Title page of Waverley, volume II in a set of the Waverley Novels published by A. & C. Black, depicting Edinburgh Castle. Approaching Edinburgh in Waverley (1814), ch. 39, Edward Waverly sees Edinburgh Castle besieged by a Jacobite army and is struck by the appearance of 'grandeur and gloom' that results from its partial concealment by gunsmoke. The Castle is also mentioned in other novels by Scott, notably The Heart of Midlothian (1818), and is described in his Provincial Antiquities & Picturesque Scenery of Scotland (1826). It was also at Edinburgh Castle that on 4 February 1818 Scott helped discover the lost Regalia (or Crown Jewels) of Scotland. The original wood engraving, probably by John Greenaway, was made for the Abbotsford edition of the Waverley Novels (1842-1847). Scott, W. Waverley.

Battle of Bothwell Bridge Engraving of the Battle of Bothwell Bridge by G. Greatbach Depicts the opposing armies of the Government and the Covenanters clashing on Bothwell Bridge, South Lanarkshire. The Battle of Bothwell Bridge (22 June 1679) saw a government army under James, Duke of Monmouth, decisively defeat an army of Covenanters and effectively put an end to their rebellion. It is dramatized in ch. 31-32 of Scott's Old Mortality (1816). Scott also included the traditional 'Ballad of Bothwell Brig' in his Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border (1802-1803), adding extensive historical notes, and gave a further account of the battle in the Second Series of his Tales of a Grandfather (1828).

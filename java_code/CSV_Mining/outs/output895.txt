The Challenge: From the Painting in the Collection of W. Cuthbert Quilter, Esq. Engraving by J. Stephenson after a painting by W. Q. Orchardson depicting a scene from Scott's novel Peveril of the Peak Depicts Sir Jasper Cranbourne presenting Geoffrey Peveril's challenge to Major Bridgenorth (Peveril of the Peak, ch. 9). Illustrates the following text: 'So saying, he [Cranbourne] took his sheathed rapier from his belt, and passing the point through the silk thread which secured the letter, he once more, and literally at sword point, gracefully tendered it to Major Bridgenorth who again waved it aside, though colouring deeply at the same time, as if he was putting a marked constraint upon himself' (Peveril of the Peak, ch. 9). The third figure in the engraving is the clergyman, Mr Solsgrace, who seeks to dissuade Major Bridgenorth from accepting the challenge. 'The Challenge', one of Orchardson's most celebrated paintings was completed in 1864.     Popish Plot, 1678

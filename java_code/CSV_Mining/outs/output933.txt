[Front and back cover illustrations for an edition of The Pirate by Walter Scott]  Front and back cover of an edition of Sir Walter Scott's The Pirate. Illustrator John Leighton FSA (1822-1912) also used the nom-de-plume 'Luke Limner'. The figures portrayed in alcoves on the front cover are probably Captain Cleveland, the pirate of the title, and his lover Minna Troil. The engraver is John Leighton's brother Henry. The scene on the back cover illustrates the parting interview of Cleveland and Minna, with Minna's sister Brenda in the background and John Bunce, Cleveland's lieutenant looking on (ch. 40). It was engraved by (W.T.?) Green, probably after Robert Scott Lauder. Scott, W. The Pirate. Edinburgh: A. & C. Black; London: Houlston & Stoneman, [18--?]

John Bowring: From a Painting by B. E. Duppa Steel engraved portrait of John Bowring by W. Holl after a painting by B. E. Duppa Engraved portrait of the political economist and linguist Sir John Bowring (1792-1872). Bowring visited Scott at Abbotsford in 1830. Scott thought him a 'clever' and 'very agreeable' man (letter to Robert Cadell, 23 April 1830). A description of the visit and a biographical sketch of Scott are included in Autobiographical Recollections of Sir John Bowring (1877). Bowring was also part of the Committee which organized the celebration of the centenary of Scott's birth in Melrose in 1871. The engraving by William Holl the Younger was first published in 1840; the original portrait was probably completed shortly beforehand.

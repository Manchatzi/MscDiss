Fast Castle: From the Sea Lithograph of Fast Castle by T. Picken after H. Bright Depicts Fast Castle near St Abbs Head, Berwickshire. Fast Castle has been identified as an inspiration for Wolf's Crag, the home of the Master of Ravenswood in Sir Walter Scott's The Bride of Lammermoor (1819). In the Magnum Opus edition of the novel (1830), Scott claims that he cannot comment on the perceived resemblance between Wolf's Crag and Fast Castle as he has only seen the latter from the sea. He acknowledges, however, that the position of Fast Castle resembles that of Wolf's Crag. Scott also describes the castle in Provincial Antiquities & Picturesque Scenery of Scotland (1826). Scott owned a painting of Fast Castle by the Rev. John Thomson (Letters, VIII, 459). Lawson, J.P. Scotland Delineated: In a Series of Views by Clarkson Stanfield. London: J.

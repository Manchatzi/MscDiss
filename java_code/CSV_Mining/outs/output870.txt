Linlithgow Palace Lithograph of Linlithgow Palace by T. Picken after D. Roberts Depicts Linlithgow Palace and Linlithgow Loch (West Lothian). Linlithgow Palace was built in the eleventh century and was a royal residence from the twelfth to the late sixteenth century. It was accidentally gutted by fire in 1746. In Marmion (1808), Sir Walter Scott describes Linlithgow as: 'Of all the palaces so fair, | Built for the royal dwelling, | In Scotland, far beyond compare | Linlithgow is excelling;' (canto IV, stanza XV, lines 1-4). The Palace is more fully described in Scott's Provincial Antiquities & Picturesque Scenery of Scotland (1826) and features in a number of his other works, notably Waverley (1814) and Tales of a Grandfather (1828-30). The entrance porch at Scott's home of Abbotsford was modelled after that of Linlithgow Palace. Lawson, J.P. Scotland Delineated: In a Series of Views by Clarkson Stanfield. London: J.

Eildon Hills Hand-coloured aquatint of a view of Eildon Hills by J. Merigot after J. Girten. Depicts the River Tweed with the Eildon Hills (Scottish Borders) in the background. In The Lay of the Last Minstrel (1805), Sir Walter Scott alludes to the legend that the peak of Eildon Hill was split into three by the wizard Michael Scott. The Monk of Melrose Abbey recalls meeting the wizard and tells Sir William of Deloraine: 'And, Warrior, I could say to thee | The words that cleft Eildon hills in three, | And bridled the Tweed with a curb of stone: | But to speak them were a deadly sin | And for having but thought them my heart within | A treble penance must be done' (canto II, stanza 13, lines 8-13). Scott's first aborted attempt to write a prose romance Thomas the Rhymer revolved around the legend that a cavern existed beneath the Eildon Hills, where King Arthur and his knights lay sleeping (see the General Introduction to the Waverley Novels (1829)). The Hills are mentioned in numerous other works by Scott, notably 'The Eve of St John' (1799). The prospect of the Eildon Hills from Bemersyde was a favourite of Scott's and is now known as 'Scott's view'. Stoddart J.

Fingal's Cave, Staffa Engraving of Fingal's Cave at Staffa by G. Aikman after T. Allom Depicts the basalt columns of Fingal's Cave, Staffa, Inner Hebrides. Walter Scott visited Fingal's Cave in 1810: 'It exceeded in my mind every description I had heard of it [...] the appearance of the cavern composed entirely of basaltic pillars as high as the roof of a cathedral and running deep into the rock, eternally swept by a deep and swelling sea, and paved as it were with ruddy marble baffles all description' (Letter to Joanna Baillie, July 19, 1810). He subsequently described the cave in The Lord of the Isles (1815), canto IV, stanza X: 'that wondrous dome, | Where, as to shame the temples deck'd | By skill of earthly architect, | Nature herself, it seem'd, would raise | A Minster to her Maker's praise!' (lines 13-17). Black's Picturesque Tourist of Scotland. Edinburgh: Adam and Charles Black, 1840   Fingal's Cave

View of Edinburgh: From the Castle Lithograph of Edinburgh from the Castle by T. Picken after D. Roberts Presents a view of Edinburgh city centre from the Castle ramparts. To the left may be seen the recently completed Scott Monument. Sir Walter Scott was born and raised in Edinburgh and worked there, first as an Advocate from 1792 to 1806, then as Clerk of the Court of Session until his retirement in 1830. The city features in many of his works, most notably The Heart of Mid-Lothian (1818). Edinburgh Castle is the city's most prominent landmark. It was here that on 4 February 1818 Scott helped discover the lost Regalia (or Crown Jewels) of Scotland. The Castle also figures in a number of Scott's novels, notably Waverley and The Heart of Midlothian, and is described in his Provincial Antiquities & Picturesque Scenery of Scotland (1826).

Lady Augusta Engraved portrait by W.H. Egleston after J.W. Wright of the heroine of Scott's novel Castle Dangerous Engraved half-length portrait of Lady Augusta de Berkely, heroine of Sir Walter Scott's Castle Dangerous (1831), disguised as a male pilgrim. The portrait illustrates the line: 'In a moment, I think, of madness, I resolved to set out in this masculine disguise' (ch. 11). Lady Augusta, an English heiress, has promised to marry Sir John de Walton if he can defend the strategically vital Castle Douglas against the forces of Robert the Bruce and Sir James Douglas (the 'Black Douglas') for a year and a day. Increasingly alarmed, though, by the danger he is running, she travels to Douglasdale in masculine disguise. The scallop shell was the universally recognized badge of a pilgrim.

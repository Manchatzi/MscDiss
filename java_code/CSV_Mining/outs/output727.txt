Norham Castle Facsimile of a pencil drawing of Norham Castle by G. Home Depicts the River Tweed with Norham Castle, Northumberland, in the background. Sir Walter Scott's Marmion (1808) begins with the arrival of Lord Marmion at Norham Castle: 'Day set on Norham's castled steep, | And Tweed's fair river, broad and deep, | And Cheviot's mountains lone: | The battled towers, the donjon keep, | The loophole grates, where captives weep, | The flanking walls that round it sweep, | In yellow lustre shone' (canto I, stanza I, lines 1-7) . Lord Marmion spends the night at Norham then proceeds on a mission to the Scottish Court. Baikie, J. The Charm of the Scott Country. London: A. & C. Black, 1927 (facing p. 48)   Norham Castle

Edinburgh: From Craigleith Quarry Lithograph of Edinburgh from Craigleith Quarry by T. Picken after W. L. Leitch Depicts Craigleith Quarry with a view of Edinburgh city in the background. Sir Walter Scott was born and raised in Edinburgh and worked there, first as an Advocate from 1792 to 1806, then as Clerk of the Court of Session until his retirement in 1830. The city features in many of his works, most notably The Heart of Mid-Lothian (1818). Craigleith Quarry provided much of the fine sandstone used in building Edinburgh's New Town in the 18th and 19th centuries. It was first worked to provide stone for Edinburgh Castle in the 17th century. Lawson, J.P. Scotland Delineated: In a Series of Views by Clarkson Stanfield. London: J. Hogarth, 1847-1854.

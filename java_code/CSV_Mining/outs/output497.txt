F̩n̩lon [sic]: From the Original Picture by Vivien in the Collection at the Louvre Steel engraved portrait of F̩nelon by J. Thomson after a painting by Vivien Engraved portrait of the French theologian and novelist Francois de Salignac de la Mothe-F̩nelon (1651-1715). In his Introduction to the Magnum Opus edition of Quentin Durward (1831), Sir Walter Scott quotes F̩nelon's description of the paranoid solitude of the tyrant Pygmalion in Book 3 of Les Aventures de T̩l̩maque (1699). In common with most scholars, Sir Walter Scott believes that in Pygmalion F̩nelon intended to portray Louis XI of France. Scott's own portrayal of Louis in Quentin Durward owes much to F̩nelon's Pygmalion. The Portrait Gallery of Distinguished Poets, vol. II. London: Wm. S. Orr & Co., 1853

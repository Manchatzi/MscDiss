Hale: From an Original Picture in the Library of Lincolns Inn Steel engraved portrait of Sir Matthew Hale by J. W. Cook after a painting by John Michael Wright Engraved portrait of the English jurist Sir Matthew Hale (1609-1676). In Letter VIII of Letters on Demonology and Witchcraft (1830), Sir Walter Scott regrets to quote 'the venerable and devout Sir Matthew Hales [sic]', as presiding at a trial in 1644 which saw two women Amy Dunny and Rose Callender hanged as witches on the flimsiest evidence. 'But no man', adds Scott, 'unless very peculiarly circumstanced, can extricate himself from the prejudices of his nation and age.' Scott had previously published the final recommendations of the Hale Committee (1652) on law reform in the Somers Tracts, vol. VI (1811). He quoted from this document in his own 'Essay on Juridical Reform' (1810). The original portrait was painted ca. 1670. The Portrait Gallery of Distinguished Poets, vol. II. London: Wm. S. Orr & Co., 1853

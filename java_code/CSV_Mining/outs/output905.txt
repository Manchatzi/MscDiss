[Covent Garden Theatre playbill for The Maid of Judah; or Knights Templars, based on Sir Walter Scott's novel, Ivanhoe]  Playbill for The Maid of Judah, or Knights Templars; also advertises The Army of the North, among other productions. The Maid of Judah is an adaptation by Michael Rophino Lacy (1795-1867) of Rossini's pasticcio Ivanho̩. Ivanho̩ was first performed at the Od̩on, Paris, on 15 September 1826, with a libretto by Emile Deschamps and Gustave de Wailly. The music was selected from four Rossini operas, Semiramide, Mos̬, Tancredi, and La gazza ladra, and arranged by Antonio Pacini. Scott himself was in the audience for the 31 October performance and wrote in his Journal: 'It was superbly got up, the Norman soldiers wearing pointed helmets and what resembled much hauberks of mail, which looked very well. The number of the attendants, and the skill with which they were moved and grouped on the stage, were well worthy of notice. It was an opera, and of course the story greatly mangled, and the dialogue in a great part nonsense. Yet it was strange to hear anything like the words which I (then in an agony of pain with spasms in my stomach) dictated to William Laidlaw at Abbotsford, now recited in a foreign tongue, and for the amusement of a strange people.' Lacy's adaptation was first performed at Covent Garden on 7 March 1829.

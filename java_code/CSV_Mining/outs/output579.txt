Barnard Castle, Durham Engraving of Barnard Castle by E. Finden after W. Westall Depicts the moonlit ruins of Barnard Castle, County Durham. Barnard Castle features in Sir Walter Scott's poem Rokeby: 'Those towers, which in the changeful gleam | Throw murky shadows on the stream, | Those towers of Barnard hold a guest, | The emotions of whose troubled breast, | In wild and strange confusion driven, | Rival the flitting rack of heaven.'

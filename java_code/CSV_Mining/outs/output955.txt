General Thomas Dalyell of Binns Engraved title page and frontispiece of Scott's Old Mortality Title page of Old Mortality, volume XI of a set of the Waverley Novels published by A. & C. Black, featuring General Thomas Dalyell (1615-1685). Commander-in-Chief of the army in Scotland from 1661 to 1685, General Thomas Dalyell earned the epithet 'Bluidy Tam' after his suppression of the Covenanters at Rullion Green in 1666. In Old Mortality (1816) Scott describes him as 'as much feared for his cruelty and indifference to human life and human sufferings, as respected for his steady loyalty and undaunted valour'. The General also appears as a demonic ghost in 'Wandering Willie's Tale' in Redgauntlet (1824). The Dickes portrait appears to be based on an original portrait by David Paton (fl. 1660-1698). The wood engraving was originally made for the Abbotsford Edition of the Waverley Novels (1842-1847). Scott, W. Old Mortality. Edinburgh: Adam and Charles Black, [185-?]

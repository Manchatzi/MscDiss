The Ettrick Shepherd Engraved portrait of James Hogg by W. H. Lizars after J. G. Lockhart Engraved portrait of Scottish author James Hogg (1770-1835). Sir Walter Scott met the poet and novelist James Hogg, known as the 'Ettrick Shepherd', while researching material for Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border (1802-03). Scott remained his lifelong friend and patron. Following Scott's death, Hogg published The Domestic Manners and Private Life of Sir Walter Scott (1834). This portrait was engraved by William Home Lizars, son of Daniel Lizars. Although Daniel Lizars died in 1812, the family occasionally continued to use W&D Lizars as their signature. The artist signature P.M. refers to Peter Morris, the alias adopted by J. G. Lockhart in Peter's Letters to his Kinfolk (1819). Lockhart, J. G. Peter's Letters to His Kinsfolk. Vol. III.

Sir Walter Scott Bart. Engraved portrait of Sir Walter Scott by Roffe after H. Raeburn Head and shoulders portrait, facing right, of Sir Walter Scott at the age of thirty-six. Scott sat for the original portrait by Sir Henry Raeburn in spring 1808. Commissioned by Archibald Constable, it was completed in the same year. It is now in the possession of the Duke of Buccleuch and Queensberry at Bowhill. This engraving was originally published in The Mirror of Literature, 1826. The engraver was probably John Roffe (1769-1850). It is likely, however, that part of Roffe's work has been confused with that of an identically named engraver, possibly a son, active between 1820 and 1861. Roffe's engraving is itself based on an 1810 mezzotint by Charles Turner and an 1821 engraving by J. R. West. Tillotson, J. Lives of Eminent Men, or Biographical Treasury. London: Thomas Holmes, [185-?] (facing p.173)

Napoleon Bonaparte, 1802 Engraving by C. Rolls of a painting by J.-B. Isabey depicting Napoleon Bonaparte Portrays Napoleon Bonaparte in the grounds of the Ch̢teau de Malmaison, the country house bought by his wife Jos̩phine de Beauharnais, which was from 1800 to 1802 seat of the French government. This is the frontispiece to the 1834 edition of Scott's Life of Napoleon Bonaparte, which was first published in nine volumes in 1827. In a letter to Lady Abercorn (April 21, 1824), Scott described Napoleon as 'a strange mingled phantom of grandeur and terror and a little meanness withal as ever bestrode the destinies of the world'. The original portrait by Isabey was considered to be one of the closest likenesses of Napoleon. Scott, W. Life of Napoleon Buonaparte. Edinburgh: Robert Cadell, 1834 (frontispiece)

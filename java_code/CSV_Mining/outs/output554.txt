The Author of Waverley in his Study Engraved portrait of Sir Walter Scott in his study by E. Goodall after W. Allan Portrait of Sir Walter Scott, aged around fifty-six, sitting at his desk in his study at Abbotsford. The original portrait by William Allan was painted from sketches of Sir Walter Scott's study at Abbotsford, possibly made when Allan was working on his oil sketch A F̻te Champ̻tre at Abbotsford in August 1827. The editor of The Anniversary notes that some minor changes to the arrangement took place after these sketches were taken. Francis Russell suggests that the painting may have been made specifically in order to be engraved (Portraits of Sir Walter Scott, p. 25). Cunningham, A. (ed).

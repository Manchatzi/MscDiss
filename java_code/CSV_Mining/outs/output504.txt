George II Engraved portrait of George II by S. F. Ravenet probably after T. Worlidge Engraved profile portrait of George II, King of Great Britain (1683-1760). Sir Walter Scott's first novel Waverley (1814) is set during the Jacobite Rebellion of 1745-46 which sought to place Charles Edward Stewart on the British throne in place of the Hanoverian George II. The hero, Edward Waverley, is arrested on a charge of 'levying war against the king, the highest delinquency of which a subject can be guilty' (ch. 31). A further fictional rebellion against George II is described in Redgauntlet (1824). Here the ultimate failure of the Jacobite cause is proved by the reading of George II's personal orders to let the conspirators return in peace to the Continent (ch. 23). The Jacobite Rebellions are also described in Tales of a Grandfather, Third Series (1829), where Scott terms Georges I and II 'men of honour, courage, and good sense; but, being born and educated foreigners [...] strangers to the peculiar character, no less than to the very complicated form of government, of the country over which they were called by Providence to reign'. Despite Scott's insistence on George II's 'good sense', there are references in The Heart of Mid-Lothian (1818) to his notorious temper. Miss Damahoy has heard 'that King George flang his periwig in the fire when he heard o' the Porteous mob', kicked Sir Robert Walpole, and, according to Bartholomew Saddletree 'was for kicking the Duke of Argylle too'. Miss Damahoy concludes that 'he might keep mair wit in his anger' (ch. 23). In the same novel Jeanie Deans successfully pleads with Queen Caroline to intercede with George II to pardon her sister Effie. The engraving by Ravenet is probably derived from a 1753 painting by Thomas Worlidge.     Jacobite Rebellion, 1745-1746

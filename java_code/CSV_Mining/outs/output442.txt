Bentham Steel engraved portrait of Bentham by J. Posselwhite after a painting by G.F. Watts Engraved portrait of the Utilitarian philosopher and political economist Jeremy Bentham (1748-1832). On 17 February 1823, Bentham wrote to Samuel Parr describing an engraving by Robert Bowyer of George Hayter's painting View of the Interior of the House of Lords during the Trial of Queen Caroline, 1820. Among the audience, Hayter had portrayed many public figures of the day, placing Bentham, to his dismay, next to Sir Walter Scott 'the servile poet and novelist'. Scott never mentioned Bentham by name but, both explicitly in his political pamphlets and implicitly in his novels, he attacked his projects for juridical reform which he feared would destroy national characteristics and traditions. When both men died in close proximity in 1832, obituarists presented them as figureheads of the two opposing currents of nineteenth-century thought: Utilitarianism and Romanticism. The original portrait by George Frederick Watts (not 'J. Watts' as indicated in the caption) was taken in 1837 from Bentham's 'Auto-Icon' (now on display at University College London).

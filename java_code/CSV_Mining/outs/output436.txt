Ariosto: From a Print by Raffaelle Morghen Steel engraved portrait of Ariosto by R. Hart after R. Morghen after D. Dossi Portrait of the Italian poet Lodovico Ariosto (1474-1533). Ariosto's epic Orlando furioso (1516) was a favourite of Sir Walter Scott's from childhood onwards and exerted a lasting influence on his own verse. Over dinner with Captain Edward Cheney in Frascati on 1 May 1832, Scott claimed to read it once a year. At Edinburgh University he outraged his Greek professor by submitting an essay in which he argued that Ariosto was superior to Homer. While a college student, Scott took private Italian lessons to be able to read Ariosto, Tasso, and Boiardo in the original. Scott gave Edward Waverley, hero of his first novel (1814), much of his own love of Italian Romance. Francis Osbaldistone too in Rob Roy (1817) courts Diana Vernon by reading his translation of the first books of the Orlando furioso (ch. 16). Hart's engraving is based on an earlier engraving by Raphael Morghen (1809), which was itself freely derived from a 16th-century portrait by Dosso Dossi.

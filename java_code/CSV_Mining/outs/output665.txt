Lincluden College Engraving of Lincluden Collegiate Church by an unattributed artist Depicts the ruins of Lincluden Collegiate Church, Dumfriesshire. Lincluden College was established in 1389 by Archibald the Grim, Lord of Galloway. According to the Magnum Opus edition of The Heart of Mid-Lothian (1830), it was here that Helen Goldie, Scott's source for the tale, first met Helen Walker, the prototype for Jeanie Deans. It has also been suggested that the monastic ruins which Guy Mannering sketches in the opening chapter of the novel of that name are those of Lincluden College. Forsyth, R. The Beauties of Scotland.

Sir Walter Scott's poem 'The Maid of Neidpath' was published in William Whyte's A Collection of Scottish Airs (1806-07): 'Disease had been in Mary's bower | And slow decay from mourning, | Though now she sits on Neidpath's tower | To watch her Love's returning' (lines 5-8). Neidpath, near Peebles, is a 14th-century castle converted into a 17th-century tower house. At the turn of the 19th century, it was home to Scott's close friend Adam Ferguson.

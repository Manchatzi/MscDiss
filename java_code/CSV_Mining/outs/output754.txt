Turnberry Castle, Ayrshire Engraving of Turnberry Castle by J. Stewart after P. Gibson Depicts Turnberry Castle, Ayrshire, with Ailsa Craig in the background. Edith, the heroine of Walter Scott's The Lord of the Isles (1815), is captured by the English at Turnberry Castle, the ancestral home and birthplace of Robert the Bruce. The Bruce lays siege to the castle, rescues Edith, and goes on to regain most of Scotland. Scott had never visited Turnberry Castle so, while working on The Lord of the Isles in 1814, requested and obtained local information from his friend the Gallowegian antiquarian Joseph Train. The castle was demolished by the Bruce himself in 1310 to prevent it from falling into English hands. It was never rebuilt. Forsyth, R. The Beauties of Scotland. Vol. II.

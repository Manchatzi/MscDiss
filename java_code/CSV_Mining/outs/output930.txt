Sir Walter Scott, Bart., Born 1771: Died 1832 Coloured lithograph of Sir Walter Scott by Riddle and Couchman Colour lithograph half-length portrait of Sir Walter Scott. This lithograph produced by the established London firm of Riddle & Couchman appears to be freely based on the 1823 portrait of Scott painted by Sir Henry Raeburn for his own private gallery. Scott, however, appears markedly younger in the lithograph. The Penny Poets: Bryant, Spenser, Keats, Scott. London: Review of Reviews Office, 1895

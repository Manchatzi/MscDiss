John Milton: From a Miniature of the Same Size by Faithorne, Anno 1667; in the Possession of William Falconer Esq. Engraved portrait of John Milton by T. Woolnoth after W. Faithorne Engraved oval portrait of English poet John Milton (1608-1674). Walter Scott was familiar with the works of Milton from early childhood. Alison Cockburn, a distant relative of Scott's mother, recorded her astonishment at the six-year-old Scott's precocity. When she asked his opinion of Milton, Scott expressed puzzlement that the newly-created Adam should know everything. She satisfied him with the reply that he was created perfect by God (quoted in J. G. Lockhart's Memoir of the Life of Sir Walter Scott, Bart.). Later, in the Introduction to Canto I of Marmion (1808), Scott cited Milton among the 'mightiest chiefs of British song' who did not disdain chivalrous or romantic legends: 'They gleam through Spenser's elfin dream, | And mix in Milton's heavenly theme' (lines 273-74).

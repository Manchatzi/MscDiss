The Author of Waverley Engraved portrait of Sir Walter Scott by Thomson from a bust by F. Chantrey Engraving of a bust of Sir Walter Scott aged around fifty with facsimile of signature. Scott first sat for the original plaster bust by Sir Francis Legatt Chantrey in spring 1820. This engraving is from the marble replica (known as the 'Abbotsford Bust') that Chantrey made for Scott in 1821. It was first published in the New Monthly Magazine, January 1, 1831, then reprinted as a supplement with the Court Journal of October 6, 1832. This copy is probably one of the 1832 prints. The engraver is probably James Thomson (occasionally spelt Thompson). Court Journal, October 6, 1832

Loch Ard (Perthshire): Looking West Engraving of Loch Ard by J. Swan after J. Fleming Depicts Loch Ard, Stirling, and the surrounding countryside. Loch Ard is described in chapter 20 of Scott's Rob Roy (1817): 'But the road now suddenly emerged from the forest ground, and, winding close by the margin of the loch, afforded us a full view of its spacious mirror, which now, the breeze having totally subsided, reflected in still magnificence the high dark heathy mountains, huge grey rocks, and shaggy banks, by which it is encircled.' The Falls of Ledard at the head of the Loch are thought to be the model for the waterfall in the Glen of Glennaquoich in Waverley, ch. 22. Scott recommended the Loch and the Falls as artistic subjects to Sir David Wilkie and James Skene (Letters, IV, 484, and IX, 224). Leighton, J.M. The Lakes of Scotland: A Series of Views. Glasgow: J.

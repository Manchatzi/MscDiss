James Montgomery, Author of 'The World Before the Flood', 'Songs of Zion', &c. Engraved portrait of James Montgomery by F. A. Roberts after T. H. Illidge Engraved portrait of Scottish poet and hymnist James Montgomery (1771-1854) seated at his desk In 1824 James Montgomery asked Walter Scott to contribute a poem for a propaganda work entitled The Chimney-Sweeper's Friend. Scott declined, but a portion of his response was published in the Preface. Here Scott expressed his support for Montgomery's cause, and wrote that he had had the chimneys at Abbotsford made circular and smooth so that they could be cleaned by a 'simple machine', rather than a child (letter to James Montgomery, January 4, 1824). Montgomery, who published a critical account of Marmion in The Critical Review (1808) considered Scott 'an admirable writer' except when he dealt with modern subjects: 'in his magic circle he is inimitable - out of it, a gentleman who writes with ease' (quoted in Helen C. Knight's Life of James Montgomery (1857), p. 133). He was, however, an unconditional admirer of Lockhart's biography of Scott, finding Scott's life 'more intensely attractive to my mind, and in itself even more marvellous, than any of his fictions' (ibid., p. 316). The original painting by T. H. Illidge was made in 1841 and this engraving first appeared in an edition of Robert Chambers's Lives of Illustrious and Distinguished Scotsmen. Wilson, J.G. The Poets and Poetry of Scotland. London: Blackie & Son, 1876-1877

Burke: From a Picture after Sir Joshua Reynolds in the Possession of T. H. Burke, Esq. Steel engraved portrait of Edmund Burke by C. E. Wagstaff after a painting by J. Reynolds Engraved portrait of the Irish statesman, philosopher and historian Edmund Burke (1729-1797). Burke exerted a great influence on Sir Walter Scott, both through his concept of the 'sublime' (expounded in A Philosophical Enquiry into the Origin of Our Ideas of the Sublime and Beautiful) and through his vision of an 'organic' society' (expounded in Reflections on the Revolution in France). In a letter to Henry Francis Scott, Younger of Harden, M.P. dated 10 January 1831, Scott praised 'the talents, the almost prophetic powers' of Burke: 'About 1792, when I was entering life, the admiration of the godlike system of the French Revolution was so rife, that only a few old-fashioned Jacobites and the like ventured to hint a preference for the land they lived in; or pretended to doubt that the new principles must be infused into our worn-out constitution. Burke appeared, and all the gibberish about the superior legislation of the French dissolved like an enchanted castle when the destined knight blows his horn before it.' The original portrait from the studio of Sir Joshua Reynolds was painted in 1767-69. The Portrait Gallery of Distinguished Poets, vol. III. London: Wm. S. Orr & Co., 1853

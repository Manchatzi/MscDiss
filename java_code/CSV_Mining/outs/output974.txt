Joan, Daughter of Louis XI Engraved title page and frontispiece of Scott's Quentin Durward Title page of Quentin Durward, volume XXXII of a set of the Waverley Novels published by A. & C. Black, depicting St Joan of Valois (1464-1505). Joan (or Jeanne), Duchess of Berry was the second daughter of Louis XI by his second wife Charlotte of Savoy. For dynastic purposes, Louis compelled her to marry his second cousin Louis duc d'Orl̩ans, later Louis XII. Divorced by Louis XII on his ascent to the throne, she went on to found the religious order of the Annonciades and was canonized by Pius XII. In Sir Walter Scott's Quentin Durward (1823), the duc d'Orl̩ans's passion for Isabelle de Croye threatens to thwart Louis IX's plans to marry him to her daughter. Scott describes Joan as 'pale, thin, and sickly in her complexion; her shape visibly bent to one side, and her gait [...] so unequal that she might be called lame'. In terms of appearance, eyes 'expressive of melancholy, softness, and resignation' were her only 'redeeming points'. The original wood engraving was made for the Abbotsford Edition of the Waverley Novels (1842-1847). Scott, W. Quentin Durward. Edinburgh: Adam and Charles Black, [185-?]

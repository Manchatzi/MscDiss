The Vis-Count Dundee Steel engraved portrait of Viscount Dundee by R. C. Bell after a picture by Williams Engraved portrait of the Scottish soldier and nobleman John Graham of Claverhouse, Viscount Dundee (1648-1689). Claverhouse's campaign against the Covenanters is the subject of Sir Walter Scott's Old Mortality (1816). In a footnote to the Magnum Opus edition of the novel (1830), Scott writes: 'This remarkable person united the seemingly inconsistent qualities of courage and cruelty, a disinterested and devoted loyalty to his prince, with a disregard of the rights of his fellow-subjects. He was the unscrupulous agent of the Scottish Privy Council in executing the merciless severities of the government in Scotland during the reigns of Charles II. and James II.; but he redeemed his character by the zeal with which he asserted the cause of the latter monarch after the Revolution, the military skill with which he supported it at the battle of Killiecrankie, and by his own death in the arms of victory.' Scott was fascinated by the figure of Claverhouse, whom he believed had been traduced by Presbyterian historians, and displayed a portrait of him in his study at Castle Street, Edinburgh. Claverhouse is also portrayed in 'Wandering Willie's Tale' (1824) and in the song 'Bonnie Dundee' in Scott's play The Doom of Devorgoil (1830).

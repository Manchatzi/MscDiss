Dryburgh Abbey: From the South Engraving of Dryburgh Abbey by W. H. Lizars Depicts a man walking past the south wall of the ruins of Dryburgh Abbey, Scottish Borders. Sir Walter Scott was interred in St. Mary's Aisle on September 26, 1832. Scott lamented in his 'Autobiography' (1808) that, though his ancestors, the Haliburtons, once owned the Abbey, 'we have nothing left of Dryburgh... but the right of stretching our bones.' Scott's wife, Margaret Charlotte Carpenter, his eldest son, Walter Scott, and his son-in-law and biographer, J.G. Lockhart, are also buried here. Morton, J. The Monastic Annals of Teviotdale.

Monastery: Abbey of St. Mary Kirkaldy Steel vignette engraving by Edward Finden of a scene relating to Scott's novel The Monastery Depicts the Abbey of Kennaquhair (based on Melrose Abbey, Scottish Borders) with the gates thrown open in preparation for a procession (Monastery, ch. 37). Despite the caption, the engraving is an artist's impression of Melrose Abbey prior to its ruin. It was presumably engraved by Finden after his own design. The Waverley Album.

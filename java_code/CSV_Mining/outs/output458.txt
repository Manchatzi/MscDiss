Calvin: From an Original Engraving by C. Dankertz Steel engraved portrait of Calvin by T. Woolnoth after a print by C. Dankerts Engraved portrait of the French Protestant theologian John Calvin (1509-1564). Calvin exerted a profound influence on the Reformation in Scotland and on the development of Scottish Presbyterian doctrine. Sir Walter Scott was brought up in a strict Calvinist household but came to reject many of Calvin's creeds, notably predestinarianism, and to gravitate towards the Episcopal Church. There are references to Calvin in a number of the Waverley Novels, including Old Mortality (1816), Woodstock (1826) and, in particular, The Abbot (1820) where Roland Graeme calls his Huguenot grandmother 'as strict as Calvin himself' and Mary Queen of Scots criticizes the intolerance of the 'stern preachers of the Calvinistic heresy' (ch. 31).

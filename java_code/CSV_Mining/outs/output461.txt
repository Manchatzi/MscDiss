Dr. Cartwright: From a Picture in the Possession of Miss Cartwright Steel engraved portrait of Edmund Cartwright by J. Thomson Engraved portrait of the English inventor and poet Edmund Cartwright (1743-1823). Edmund Cartwright, now primarily known as the inventor of the power loom, was also highly acclaimed as a poet during his lifetime. In his 'Essay on Imitations of the Ancient Ballad' (1830), Sir Walter Scott praises Cartwright's best-known poem 'Armine and Elvira' which contains 'some excellent poetry, expressed with unusual felicity'. He adds that he recalls meeting Cartwright in 'very early youth' at the house of his grandfather John Rutherford, and that 'he was the first living poet I recollect to have seen'. The original portrait is by fellow inventor Robert Fulton (1765-1815). The Portrait Gallery of Distinguished Poets, vol. III. London: Wm. S. Orr & Co., 1853

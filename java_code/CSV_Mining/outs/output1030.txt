The Portrait Engraved by Woolnoth and the Emblematical Design by Hawksworth Engraved portrait of Walter Scott by T. Woolnoth after A. Geddes, with ornamental frieze by J. Hawkesworth Engraved portrait of Walter Scott (aged forty-seven or forty-eight), surrounded by a Gothic border with vignettes taken from his poems. The original portrait by Andrew Geddes began life as a study for his The Discovery of the Regalia of Scotland (1821). The sitting took place some time between 4 February 1818, the date of the discovery of the Regalia, and the beginning of 1819 when Scott fell seriously ill. The portrait suggests that Scott's health is already deteriorating. Originally purchased by the collector Sir James Stuart, 7th Baronet of Allanbank, the picture now hangs in the Scottish National Portrait Gallery. Woolnoth's engraving is after a drawing by Geddes himself, or possibly after an earlier engraving by F.C. Lewis (1824). The ornamental frieze by Hawkesworth features scenes from Scott's poems, some based on illustrations by Richard Westall. Scott had not yet publicly acknowledged authorship of the Waverley Novels (he would do so in 1827). The Spirit of the Public Journals for the Year M.DCCC.XXV.

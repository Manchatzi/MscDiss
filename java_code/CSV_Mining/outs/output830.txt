In Sir Walter Scott's Marmion (1808), Lord Marmion and Lord Lindesay spend two days at Crichton Castle in Midlothian: 'Crichtoun! though now thy miry court | But pens the lazy steer and sheep, | Thy turrets rude, and totter'd Keep, | Have been the minstrel's loved resort' (canto IV, stanza XI, lines 1-4). The castle is described in detail in stanzas X-XI of the poem. Scott traces the history of the fourteenth-century castle in Provincial Antiquities and Picturesque Scenery of Scotland (1826).

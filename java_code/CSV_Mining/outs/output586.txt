Branxholm Tower Facsimile of a painting of Branxholme Castle by E.W. Haslehust Presents a view of Branxholme Castle, near Hawick, Scottish Borders, with the River Teviot in the foreground. Branxholme Castle is the ancient seat of the Dukes of Buccleuch, and provides the setting for much of The Lay of the Last Minstrel. Alternative spellings include Branxholm and Branksome, the latter preferred by Scott. The Lay of the Last Minstrel portrays the efforts of the Lady of Branksome to prevent marriage between her daughter and a feudal enemy and the siege of Branksome at the hands of an English army.

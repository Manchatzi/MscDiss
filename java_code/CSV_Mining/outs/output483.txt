Dante Alighieri: From a Print by Raffaelle Morghen after a Picture by Tofanelli Steel engraved portrait of Dante by C. E. Wagstaff after an original picture by Tofanelli Engraved portrait of the Italian poet Dante Alighieri (1265-1321). While a college student, Scott took private Italian lessons to be able to read Ariosto, Tasso, Boiardo, and Dante in the original. His admiration for Dante, however, was always qualified. Discussing the Inferno with Anna Seward, Scott complained that 'the plan appeared to him unhappy; the personal malignity and strange mode of revenge presumptuous and uninteresting'. In Italy in 1832, he told Captain Edward Cheney that he found Dante too obscure and difficult and thought it 'mortifying that Dante seemed to think nobody worth being sent to hell but his own Italians, whereas other people had every bit as great rogues in their families, whose misdeeds were suffered to pass with impunity'. Scott had forgotten that Dante had damned his own ancestor, the wizard Michael Scott. In chapter 12 of Rob Roy (1817), Diana Vernon seeks a pretext for a private interview with Frank Osbaldistone and asks for help deciphering a 'difficult passage' in the 'obscure Florentine's Divine Comedy. Frank's rival Rashleigh offers to accompany them as he is 'something better skilled [...] at tracking the sense of Dante through the metaphors and elisions of his wild and gloomy poem'. The print is derived from an earlier engraving by Raphael Morghen taken from a portrait by Stefano Tofanelli (1752-1812). The Portrait Gallery of Distinguished Poets, vol. I. London: Wm. S.

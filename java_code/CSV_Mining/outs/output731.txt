Preston, Lancashire Engraving of a street in Preston, Lancashire, by E. Finden after W. Westall Depicts the Church of St John the Evangelist in Preston, Lancashire, with a view of Church Street and Fishergate. The Battle of Preston (1715), in which the Jacobites were defeated by the Hanoverian army, features in a number of Scott's works. In Waverley (1814), Sir Everard Waverley befriends the Baron of Bradwardine when the latter is taken prisoner after the battle (ch. 6). In Rob Roy (1817), Frank Osbaldistone's uncle Sir Hildebrand and cousin John are taken prisoner and his cousin Wilfred killed in the engagement (ch. 37). In The Black Dwarf (1816), Sir Frederick Langley is also taken captive after the battle and subsequently executed. The Jacobite campaign of 1715 is discussed in depth in Scott's Tales of a Grandfather, Third Series (1830). The church building depicted in this engraving was demolished in 1853 and a new church, Preston Minster, was built on the original foundations. Moule, T.

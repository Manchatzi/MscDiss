Vue du Bourg et des Ruines de l'Abbaye de DRYBURGH Engraving of Dryburgh Abbey and its grounds by J. Goeree Presents a view of the ruins of Dryburgh Abbey, Scottish Borders, from the south bank of the River Tweed. Sir Walter Scott was interred in St. Mary's Aisle, Dryburgh Abbey, on September 26, 1832. Scott lamented in his 'Autobiography' that, though his ancestors, the Haliburtons, once owned the Abbey, 'we have nothing left of Dryburgh... but the right of stretching our bones.' Scott's wife, Margaret Charlotte Carpenter, his eldest son, Walter Scott, and his son-in-law and biographer, J.G. Lockhart, are also buried here. The original engraving, probably by Jan Goeree, was made expressly for Les d̩lices de la Grand' Bretagne, & de l'Irelande by James Beeverell. The engravings in this publication are largely based on previously published work. Beeverell, J. Les D̩lices de la Grand' Bretagne, & de l'Irelande. Vol. VI.

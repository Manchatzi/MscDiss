Marie R. Engraved portrait of Mary, Queen of Scots by G. B. Shaw after J. Thomson after an unknown artist Engraved portrait of Mary, Queen of Scots (1542-1587) in a black velvet robe. The plot of Sir Walter Scott's The Abbot (1820) revolves around the imprisonment and escape from Loch Leven Castle, Fife, of Mary, Queen of Scots. Scott also treats her reign at length in his historical works Tales of a Grandfather, First Series (1828) and The History of Scotland (1830). The following quote from Walter Scott's The Abbot (Chapter 21) is below the engraved portrait: "Her dress was a robe of black velvet, a small ruff open in front, gave a full view of her beautifully formed chin and neck. On her head she wore a small cap of lace, and a transparent white veil hung from her shoulders over the long black robe in, large loose folds." The engraving by George B. Shaw is based on an earlier engraving by James Thomson which appeared in Edmund Lodge's Portraits of Illustrious Personages of Great Britain. The original painting by an unknown artist is known as the Morton or Dalmahoy Portrait. Scott, W. The Abbot. Edinburgh: Adam and Charles Black, 1877

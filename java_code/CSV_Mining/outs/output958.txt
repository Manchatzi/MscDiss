Archibald Marquis of Argyle Engraved title page and frontispiece of Scott's A Legend of Montrose Title page of A Legend of Montrose, volume XV of a set of the Waverley Novels published by A. & C. Black, depicting Archibald Campbell, 1st Marquis of Argyll (1607-1661). Sir Walter Scott's A Legend of Montrose (1819) is set during the campaign of James Graham, Earl of Montrose, against the Covenanters in the Highlands in 1644-1645. The Marquis of Argyll met Montrose in a series of battles, finally defeating him at Philiphaugh in 1645. Scott describes Argyll as 'a man rather of political enterprise than personal courage, and better calculated to manage an intrigue of state, than to control the tribes of hostile mountaineers' (A Legend of Montrose, ch. 1). The Dickes portrait of the Marquis of Argyll is drawn from an 'old print', possibly a 1713 engraving by Michael Vandergucht after an unknown artist. The original wood engraving was made for the Abbotsford edition of the Waverley Novels (1842-1847). Scott, W. A Legend of Montrose. Edinburgh: Adam and Charles Black, [185-?]

The Field of Prestonpan: (Death of Colonel Gardiner) Lithograph of the Battle of Prestonpans by E. Walker after W. Allan Depicts the death of Colonel Gardiner at the Battle of Prestonpans (Waverley, ch. 18). The Battle of Prestonpans (September 21, 1745) saw Charles Edward Stuart's Jacobite army defeat Sir John Cope's Hanoverian troups. It is depicted in Sir Walter Scott's novel Waverley (1814), where the eponymous hero deserts Colonel Gardiner's Hanoverian dragoons to join the Jacobites. Scott thus describes the fall of Gardiner (a real-life figure): 'Waverley, as he cast his eyes towards this scene of smoke and slaughter, observed Colonel Gardiner, deserted by his own soldiers in spite of all his attempts to rally them, yet spurring his horse through the field to take the command of a small body of infantry... Waverley could perceive that he had already received many wounds, his clothes and saddle being marked with blood. To save this good and brave man, became the instant object of his most anxious exertions. But he could only witness his fall. Ere Edward could make his way among the Highlanders, who, furious and eager for spoil, now thronged upon each other, he saw his former commander brought from his horse by the blow of a scythe, and beheld him receive, while on the ground, more wounds than would have let out twenty lives.' The battle and Gardiner's death are also described in Tales of a Grandfather, Third Series (1829). Lawson, J.P. Scotland Delineated: In a Series of Views by Clarkson Stanfield. London: J.

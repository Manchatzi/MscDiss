Cuvier: From an Original Drawing in the Possession of the Baroness Cuvier, at Paris Steel engraved portrait by J. Thomson Engraved portrait of the French naturalist and zoologist Georges, Baron Cuvier (1769-1832). Sir Walter Scott's biographer and son-in-law J. G. Lockhart wrote that the deaths of Goethe, Scott, and Cuvier in 1832 saw Germany, Britain, and France simultaneously mourning over their greatest intellects, an observation made by a number of obituarists. Ralph Waldo Emerson in English Traits also noted erroneously that Scott and Cuvier shared the same date of birth, a mistake frequently repeated by later writers. The original portrait may be a drawing by FranÌ¤ois-Joseph Heim, now in the Louvre. The Portrait Gallery of Distinguished Poets, vol. II. London: Wm. S. Orr & Co., 1853

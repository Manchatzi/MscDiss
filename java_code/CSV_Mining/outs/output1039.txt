Sir Walter Scott: From the Original in Possession of the Publishers Engraved portrait of Walter Scott by H. Robinson after J. W. Gordon Engraved three-quarter portrait of Walter Scott, seated in a study. The original portrait by John Watson Gordon was probably painted to be engraved by Samuel Freeman for Robert Chambers's Lives of Eminent Scotsmen, vol. 4 (Glasgow: Blackie & Son, 1835). It derives from an earlier unfinished portrait by Gordon, painted in spring 1830 and now held by the Scottish National Portrait Gallery. The engraving by Robinson was first published by Blackie & Son in 1837. It adds a chair, bookshelves, curtains, and the Byron urn to the Gordon/Freeman original.

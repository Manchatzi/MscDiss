Loch of Monteath, Perthshire: Looking South East Engraving of the Lake of Menteith by J. Swan after J. Fleming Depicts the Lake of Menteith and Inchmahome Priory, Stirling, with a family seated by the shore. The Lake of Menteith (or Monteath) on the Flanders Moss is often called the only lake, as opposed to 'loch', in Scotland. It is glimpsed briefly in Rob Roy, ch. 32. There are further references to the historical lands of Menteith in The Lady of the Lake and in A Legend of Montrose, where the Earl of Menteith plays a significant role. An island on the lake is the site of Inchmahome Priory where the infant Mary Queen of Scots took refuge after the defeat of the Scottish army at Pinkie Cleuch (1547). Leighton, J.M.

Scott's Favourite View from Bemersyde Hill, Roxburghshire. Facsimile of a painting of the River Tweed and the Eildon Hills by H.S. Palmer Presents a view of the River Tweed, the Tweed Valley, and the Eildon Hills from Bemersyde Hill near Melrose, Scottish Borders. According to popular tradition, Sir Walter Scott so favoured this view and paused there so frequently on his way home to Abbotsford, that his horses eventually learned to stop without command. They are reputed to have stopped at the viewpoint even when drawing Scott's funeral carriage en route for Dryburgh Abbey in 1832. Smith, W., et al. Scott Country: Water-colours. London: A. & C.

[Title page of Scott's poem The Lady of the Lake with vignette engraving by J. Pye after R. Westall]  Depicts the 'Harp of the North' hung on the witch-elm that shades St. Fillan's Spring (Lady of the Lake, canto I, stanza 1). Illustrates canto I, stanza 1, lines 1-6: 'Harp of the North! that mouldering long hast hung | On the witch-elm that shades Saint Fillan's spring | And down the fitful breeze thy numbers flung, | Till envious ivy did around thee cling, | Muffling with verdant ringlet every string,-- | O Minstrel Harp, still must thine accents sleep?'

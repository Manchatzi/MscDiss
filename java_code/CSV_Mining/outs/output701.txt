Melrose Abbey Engraving of Melrose Abbey by T. Jeavons after D. Roberts Depicts people among the ruins of Melrose Abbey, Scottish Borders. Sir Walter Scott coordinated the restoration of Melrose Abbey in 1822. The Abbey features in many of Scott's works, most famously The Lay of the Last Minstrel (1805): 'If thou would'st view fair Melrose aright, | Go visit it by the pale moonlight [...] | Then view St. David's ruin'd pile; | And, home returning, soothly swear, | Was never scene so sad and fair!' (canto II, stanza I, lines 1-2, 16-18). The religious house of Kennaquhair in The Monastery and The Abbot (both 1820) is based on the Abbey, and it is described in detail in Scott's 'Essay on Border Antiquities' (1814). The original work by David Roberts (1796-1864) was completed after 1822 and prior to 1859.    Melrose Abbey

General Monk Engraved title page and frontispiece of Scott's Woodstock Title page of Woodstock, volume XXXIX of a set the Waverley Novels published by A. & C. Black, depicting General George Monck (1608-1670). In ch. 38 of Sir Walter Scott's Woodstock (1826) news reaches the exiled Royal Court at Brussels that General Monck (or Monk) is marching South from Scotland, a move that would bring about the restoration of the Stewart dynasty. Having initially fought on the Royal side, Monck had become one of Cromwell's most trusted generals and his deputy in Scotland. On Cromwell's death, he pledged to support Cromwell's son and successor Richard. As the country descended into chaos, however, he acted to restore the monarchy. The original wood engraving was made for the Abbotsford Edition of the Waverley Novels (1842-47). According to the contents page of the Abbotsford Edition, the illustration was engraved by 'Nugent' after 'Chapman'. However, the image is clearly signed 'W. Dickes' and was probably derived from one or more pre-existing engraved portraits. Scott, W. Woodstock. Edinburgh: Adam and Charles Black, [185-?]

Rob Roy Engraved portrait of Rob Roy by W. Worthington after an original drawing Engraved portrait of Rob Roy MacGregor (1671-1734). The 18th-century Scottish freebooter and folk hero Rob Roy MacGregor is one of the principal characters (but not the protagonist) of Sir Walter Scott's 1817 novel Rob Roy. The 1829 'Magnum Opus' of the novel came complete with a historical introduction to the lives of Rob Roy and his sons, supplemented by letters and other documentation. Scott began collecting anecdotes of Rob Roy when his apprenticeship in his father's legal firm (1786-87) brought him into contact with Highland clients and eventually led to his first trips to the Highlands. One client, in particular, Alexander Stewart of Invernahyle had once fought a duel with Rob Roy. The portrait is engraved by William Henry Worthington from 'an original drawing' quite possibly by Worthington himself.

[Etching of Sir Walter Scott by R.S. Forrest after H. Raeburn]  Shoulder-length portrait of Sir Walter Scott at the age of fifty-one. In 1823 Raeburn worked simultaneously on two portraits of Scott, one for Lord Montagu of Boughton and one for Raeburn's private gallery. This etching probably derives from the latter which is now held by the Scottish National Portrait Gallery. Robert Smith Forrest (1871-1943) was active as an etcher from 1908 onwards.

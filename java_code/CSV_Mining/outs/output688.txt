Hawick appears in Sir Walter Scott's The Lay of the Last Minstrel (1805): 'Dimly he view'd the Moat-hill's mound, | Where Druid shades still flitted round; | In Hawick twinkled many a light' (canto I, stanza XXV, lines 9-11). It is described in detail in Scott's Border Antiquities of England and Scotland (1814). Hawick is also connected to Scott through the prototype for Old Mortality, Robert Patterson, who was a native of the town. Hogg, J. Tales and Sketches by the Ettrick Shepherd. Vol. VI.

Marquis of Montrose Engraving of James Graham, Marquis of Montrose by W. Holl after G. van Honthorst Depicts James Graham, Marquis of Montrose (1612-1650) in armour. Initially a Covenanter, Montrose was won over to the Royalist cause and waged a successful campaign against the Covenanters in the Highlands in 1644-1645. Sir Walter Scott's A Legend of Montrose (1819) is set against the backdrop of the 'Montrose wars'. Montrose's campaign, his subsequent betrayal by Charles II and execution by the Covenanters are also described in Scott's Tales of a Grandfather, Second Series (1829). Scott, a great admirer of Montrose, came into possession of his sword which he displayed in his 'armory' at Abbotsford. The original portrait by Gerrit van Honthorst was painted in 1649. Wylie, J. A.

The Protector Somerset Engraved title page and frontispiece of Scott's The Monastery Title page of The Monastery, volume XIX of a set of the Waverley Novels published by A. & C. Black, depicting Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset (ca. 1500-1552). Somerset was Lord Protector of England from 1547 to 1549, ruling the country in the name of the boy king Edward VI. As Warden of the Scottish Marshes, he continued to prosecute the war of 'Rough Wooing', which was designed to bring about the marriage of Edward and the infant Mary Queen of Scots. The Scots suffered a particularly devastating defeat at his hands at the Battle of Pinkie Cleugh (1547). In Sir Walter Scott's The Monastery (1820), the father of Halbert and Edward Glendinning has been killed at the battle, and Somerset is depicted encamped at Roxburgh Castle demanding tribute from the Scots (ch. 2). The original wood engraving, probably by Charles Green, was made for the Abbotsford Edition of the Waverley Novels (1842-1847). Scott, W. The Monastery. Edinburgh: Adam and Charles Black, [185-?]

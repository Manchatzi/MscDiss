The view from Bemersyde Hill, near Melrose, which overlooks the Tweed Valley and Eildon Hills, was a particular favourite of Scott's. Directly under the brow of the hill lies Bemersyde House, seat of the Haigs of Bemersyde, where Scott was a frequent visitor. The house incorporates a rectangular tower built around 1535 which was restored and greatly extended in the 18th century. Geddie, J. The Scott Country.

Minto Tower Engraving of Minto Tower by W. Thomas after F. Grose Depicts Minto Tower (or Fatlips Castle), Scottish Borders. In The Lay of the Last Minstrel (1805), Sir William of Deloraine rides past the Minto Crags on his way to Melrose Abbey: 'On Minto-crags the moonbeams glint, | Where Barnhill hew'd his bed of flint; | Who flung his outlaw'd limbs to rest, | Where falcons hang their giddy nest, | Mid cliffs, from whence his eagle eye | For many a league his prey could spy; |Cliffs, doubling, on their echoes borne, | The terrors of the robber's horn' (canto I, stanza 27, lines 5-12). Minto Tower, more commonly known by the less poetical name of Fatlips Castle, is a 16th-century tower house, situated 4 miles west of Jedburgh. It was built by the Turnbulls of Barnhill, one of whom became a notorious Border freebooter. This view was probably drawn by Francis Grose in 1789 for his Antiquities of Scotland.

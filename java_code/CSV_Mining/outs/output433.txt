Mr. Alison Steel engraved portrait of Archibald Alison by W. H. Lizars after J. G. Lockhart Vignette engraved portrait of the Scottish philosopher and divine Archibald Alison (1757-1839). Archibald Alison and Sir Walter Scott were fellow members of the Friday Club, a literary club founded in June 1803 which met every Friday evening. Alison, Minister from 1800 of the Episcopalian Chapel in Edinburgh's Cowgate, is best known as the author of Essays on the Nature and Principles of Taste (1790). It has been argued that Alison's extension of Enlightenment theories of association to the realm of aesthetics exerted a profound influence on Scott's depiction of landscape. The artist signature P.M. refers to Peter Morris, the alias adopted by J. G. Lockhart in Peter's Letters to his Kinfolk (1819). Lockhart, J. G. Peter's Letters to his Kinsfolk, vol. III.

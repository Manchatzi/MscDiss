Gibbon: From a Print by Jas. Hall after a Picture by Sir Joshua Reynolds Steel engraving of Edward Gibbon by W. Holl after a painting by J. Reynolds Engraved portrait of the English historian Edward Gibbon (1737-1794). Edward Gibbon, best known for his History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire (1776-88), was a constant source and model for Sir Walter Scott, particularly in Count Robert of Paris (1831), which drew extensively on Gibbon's account of the Byzantine Empire under the Komnenian Restoration. The Introduction to the novel quotes extensively from Gibbon's judgment of the princess and historian Anna Komnene or Comnena. The original portrait by Sir Joshua Reynolds was painted ca. 1779. The engraving by Holl is based on an earlier engraving by John (not James) Hall published in 1780. The Portrait Gallery of Distinguished Poets, vol. III. London: Wm. S. Orr & Co., 1853

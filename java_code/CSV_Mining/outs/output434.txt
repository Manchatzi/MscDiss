D'Alembert Steel engraved portrait of D'Alembert by W. Hopwood after a painting by M.-Q. de La Tour Engraved portrait of the French philosopher and mathematician Jean Le Rond d'Alembert (1717-1783). Sir Walter Scott quoted d'Alembert in his 'Memoir of Samuel Richardson', originally printed as the preface to the Ballantyne's Novelists' Library edition of Richardson's works (1824) and reprinted in Lives of the Novelists (1825). Scott is critical of the profusion of detail in Richardson's works: 'This process of miniature painting has, however, its bounds; and many readers will be disposed to acquiesce in the remark of D'Alembert,- "La Nature est bonne Ã  imiter, mais non pas jusqu'Ã  l'ennui" [It is good to imitate Nature but not ad nauseam].' The original portrait by Maurice-Quentin de La Tour was executed in pastel in 1753. The Portrait Gallery of Distinguished Poets, vol. III. London: Wm. S. Orr & Co., 1853

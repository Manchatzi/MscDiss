Greyfriars' Churchyard: Signing of the Covenant Lithograph of the signing of the National Covenant by T. Picken after G. Cattermole Depicts a crowd of people in Greyfriars Churchyard, Edinburgh, gathered to sign the National Covenant, with Edinburgh Castle in the background. In Tales of a Grandfather, Second Series (1829), Sir Walter Scott describes the mass signing of the National Covenant in Greyfriars Kirkyard, Edinburgh, which began on 28 February 1638. The Covenant challenged the Divine Right of Kings, demanding a free Scottish Parliament, a free General Assembly of the Church of Scotland, the abolition of bishops, and establishment of Presbyterian church government. The ensuing 'Covenanting' wars feature in a number of Scott's works, most notably Old Mortality (1816). Greyfriars Kirkyard also had personal associations for Scott. His and sister were both buried there in the Scott family burial-plot. According to J. G. Lockhart, Scott also made the acquaintance of his first love Williamina Belsches in the Kirkyard.

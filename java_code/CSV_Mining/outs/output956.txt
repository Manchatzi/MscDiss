John Duke of Argyle and Greenwich Engraved title page and frontispiece of Scott's The Heart of Midlothian Title page of The Heart of Midlothian, vol. XIII of a set of the Waverley Novels published by A. & C. Black, featuring John Campbell, 2nd Duke of Argyll (1678-1743). In Sir Walter Scott's The Heart of Mid-Lothian (1818), the Duke of Argyll assists Jeanie Deans in seeking the aid of Queen Caroline and ultimately provides a home on his estates for the heroine and her husband Reuben Butler. Scott wrote that 'few names deserve more honourable mention in the history of Scotland' than the Duke; he 'was alike free from the ordinary vices of statesmen, falsehood, namely, and dissimulation; and from those of warriors, inordinate and violent thirst after self-aggrandisement' (The Heart of Mid-Lothian, ch. 34). The original wood engraving, probably after William Lodge, was made for the Abbotsford Edition of the Waverley Novels (1842-1847). Scott, W. The Heart of Midlothian. Edinburgh: Adam and Charles Black, [185-?]

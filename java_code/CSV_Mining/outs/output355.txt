[Drawing of Hermitage Castle]  This sketch of Hermitage Castle, Scottish Borders, was copied from an original pencil drawing by Sir Walter Scott. The sixteenth-century castle of Hermitage was a favourite of Scott's and is described in his Essay on Border Antiquities (1814). While gathering ballads in Liddesdale Scott, carried out excavations at the Hermitage and made a sketch of the castle. A print derived from Scott's sketch was published in Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border (1802-1804), and the backdrop of Sir Henry Raeburn's 1808 portrait of Scott is also based on it.

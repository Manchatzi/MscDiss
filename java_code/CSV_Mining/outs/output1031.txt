Sir Walter Scott, and His Favorite Maida: From an Original Sketch Engraved portrait of Walter Scott by R.J Hamerton Engraved portrait of a seated Walter Scott with his dog Maida. This engraved portrait by Robert Jacob Hamerton (fl. 1831-1858) was published by J. M. M'Cormack, London, in 1832. The 'original sketch' has not been identified. The face bears a close resemblance to that in Charles Robert Leslie's 1824 portrait of Scott, especially as engraved by M. I. Danforth in 1829.

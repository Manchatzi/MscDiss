Tom Purdie, Wood Forester at Abbotsford Engraved portrait of Tom Purdie by H. Haig after E. Landseer Engraved portrait of Walter Scott's forester, Tom Purdie (d. 1829), sitting on a rock with a gun in his lap. Tom (or Tam) Purdie was first employed by Scott in 1804 as a shepherd but rose to become his forester, gamekeeper, all-round factotum, and faithful companion. In a Journal entry for 7 January 1826, Scott wrote: 'What a blessing is a man like Tom whom no familiarity can spoil, whom you may scold and praise and joke with, knowing the quality of the man is unalterable in his love and reverence for his master'. Scott was greatly shocked by his sudden death on 29 October 1829, feeling that he had 'lost feet and hands so ready was [Purdie] always to supply the want of either' (letter to Mary Ann Hughes, 1 December 1829). The original portrait by Edwin Landseer was probably made during the artist's stay at Abbotsford in October 1824. Lockhart, J. G. Memoirs of the Life of Sir Walter Scott, Bart.

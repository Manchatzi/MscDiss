The Author of 'Lalla Rookh' Facsimile reproduction of a print portrait of Thomas Moore by Daniel Maclise Facsimile of sketch of Irish poet, Thomas Moore (1779-1852), with facsimile of signature. Sir Walter Scott was a friend and admirer of Moore. He secured his collaboration in the Quarterly Review and published some of his verse in his English Minstrelsy (1810). In 1809 Walter Scott wrote an anonymous poetic imitation of Moore for the Edinburgh Annual Register. In good-humoured retaliation, Moore teased Scott in his Intercepted Letters (1813): 'Having quitted the Border to seek new renown | Is coming, by long Quarto stages to Town | And beginning with Rokeby (the job's sure to pay) | Means to do all the Gentlemen's Seats by the way.' Moore visited Scott at Abbotsford in October 1825. Scott, who had been fascinated by Moore's anecdotes of Byron, later supplied him with two letters from Byron for his edition of Letters and Journals of Lord Byron (1830). This facsimile reproduction is of one of a series of portraits originally published in Fraser's Magazine, 1830-1838, under the title 'A Gallery of Illustrious Literary Characters'. Maclise, D. The Maclise Portrait Gallery of Illustrious Literary Characters, ed. W. Bates. London: Chatto and Windus, 1883 (facing p. 18)

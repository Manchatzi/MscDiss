Lord Bacon: From a Print by J. Houbraken 1738 Steel engraved portrait of Bacon by J. Posselwhite after a print by J. Houbraken Engraved portrait of the English philosopher, statesman, and essayist Sir Francis Bacon (1561-1626). Bacon is cited on a number of occasions by Sir Walter Scott, perhaps most notably in the Introduction to the Magnum Opus Edition of The Fortunes of Nigel (1831). Here Scott identifies the reign of James I and VI as a critical moment of transition from the Age of Chivalry to the Age of Reason: 'The hour was already arrived when Bacon was about to teach the world that they were no longer to reason from authority to fact, but to establish truth by advancing from fact to fact, till they fixed an indisputable authority, not from hypothesis, but from experiment.' A further significant citation occurs in 'The Two Drovers' (1827), where the judge at the trial of Robin Oig M'Combich quotes Bacon's view of revenge as 'a kind of wild, untutored justice'. Scott also cites Bacon's views on astrology in Guy Mannering (1815) and Letters on Demonology and Witchcraft (1830). The engraving by Posselwhite is based on an earlier line engraving by Jacobus Houbraken taken from a 17th-century portrait by an unknown artist. The Portrait Gallery of Distinguished Poets, vol. I. London: Wm. S. Orr & Co., 1853

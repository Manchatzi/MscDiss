Corneille: From an Original Picture by C. Lebrun in the Possession of the Institute of France Steel engraved portrait of Corneille by T. Woolnoth from a picture by C. Le Brun Engraved portrait of the French dramatist Pierre Corneille (1606-1684). In his 'Essay on the Drama' (1819) Scott credited Corneille with overcoming the arbitrary restrictions imposed on French Classical Drama by the observance of the Aristotelian unities of time, place, and action. Despite being 'surrounded by the worst possible models', he 'vanquished the taste of his age, the competition of his rivals, and the envy of Richelieu'. Scott nonetheless regrets that in his own 'Essay on Dramatic Poetry', Corneille helped to impose the observance of the unities on future generations of French dramatists, even though they had at times forced him to 'violate the rules of probability and common sense'. In his essay on 'MoliÌ¬re' (1828), Scott considered the differences between the French classical tragedy of Corneille and Racine and the English tragedy of Shakespeare, and analysed the radically differing tastes of French and English audiences. In his The Life of Napoleon Bonaparte (1827-28), Scott attributed Napoleon's preference for Racine and Corneille over Voltaire to the fact that 'they wrote their immortal works for the meridian of a court, and at the command of the most monarchical of monarchs, Louis XIV'. Unlike Voltaire, their masterpieces contain 'nothing that can wound the ear of the most sensitive sovereign'. Corneille is, with Boileau, one of the authors for whom Frank Osbaldistone neglects his commercial studies in chapter 1 of Rob Roy (1818). The original portrait by Charles LeBrun was painted in 1647.

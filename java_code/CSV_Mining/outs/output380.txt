The Regalia of Scotland, Edinburgh Castle Albumen print by Alexander Inglis of the Scottish crown jewels Albumen print depicting the Regalia of Scotland or Scottish crown jewels. Following the Act of Union between England and Scotland in 1707, the ancient Regalia (or 'Honours') of Scotland were deposited in a locked oak chest in the Crown Room of Edinburgh Castle. Over the following decades, their whereabouts was forgotten, and it was rumoured that, counter to the terms of the Union, they had been carried away to England. Prompted by Sir Walter Scott, the Prince Regent set up a commission to search the Crown Room for the Regalia. On 4 February 1818, the Commissioners, including Scott, discovered the chest and found, wrapped in linen, the fourteenth-century Scottish Crown, the Sceptre of James V, and the Sword of State, a gift from Pope Julius II to James V. The Regalia were subsequently placed on permanent display in the Crown Room. Scott described the discovery in his Description of the Regalia of Scotland (1819). Scott, W. The Regalia of Scotland.

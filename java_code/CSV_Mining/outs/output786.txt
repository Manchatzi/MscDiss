The Right Honble. Henry Dundas Engraved portrait of Henry Dundas, Lord Melville by an unknown artist probably after J. Reynolds Engraved oval portrait of British statesman Henry Dundas, Lord Melville (1742-1811). Henry Dundas, Lord Melville was a close friend and colleague of William Pitt the Younger, serving as Treasurer of the Navy, Secretary of War and later first Lord of the Admiralty. He also controlled Crown patronage in Scotland and was often described as ipso facto ruler of Scotland. His support was thus essential when Scott applied for and obtained the posts of Sheriff-Depute of Selkirkshire (1799) and Principal Clerk to the Court of Session (1806). Lord and Lady Melville also became close friends of the Scotts. They had been Scott's childhood neighbours in George Square, Edinburgh, and Melville Castle was situated close to Scott's summer home of Lasswade. When Lord Melville was impeached for financial mismanagement in 1804, Scott composed two songs in celebration of his acquittal which were sung by James Ballantyne at a public dinner in Melville's honour. The original portrait from which this engraving was taken is probably that painted by Sir Joshua Reynolds in 1782.

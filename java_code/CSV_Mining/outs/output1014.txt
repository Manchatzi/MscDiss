Pass of Llanberis, Carnarvonshire Engraving of Llanberis Pass by W. Miller after R. K. Penson Depicts a traveller making his way through the Llanberis Pass, Wales, with Dolbadern Castle in the background. Sir Walter Scott's The Betrothed (1824) is a tale of Anglo-Welsh Border conflict set in the Welsh Marches. In ch. 9 an Anglo-Norman force lifts the siege of the castle of Garde Douleureuse. The defeated Welsh army are seen fleeing through the pass protected by the Castle: 'The single pass by which they could cross to the other side was soon completely choked by fugitives, on whose rear raged the swords of the victorious Normans. Many threw themselves into the river, upon the precarious chance of gaining the farther side, and, except a few, who were uncommonly strong, skilful, and active, perished among the rocks and in the currents'. To illustrate this scene, R. K. Penson has chosen to portray Dolbadern Castle and the Llanberis Pass, although neither is geographically close to the Welsh Marches. The original steel engraving was made for the Abbotsford Edition of the Waverley Novels (1842-1847). Scott, W. The Betrothed. Edinburgh: Adam and Charles Black, [185-?]   Llanberis

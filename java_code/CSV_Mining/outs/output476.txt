Correggio: After a Head by Himself in the Cathedral of Parma Steel engraved portrait of Correggio by H. Meyer after a self-portrait Engraved portrait of the Italian artist Correggio (1489?-1534). On first viewing Raphael's 'St Cecilia' at Bologna, Correggio exclaimed 'Anch'io son' pittore' ('I too am a painter!'). Sir Walter Scott quoted Correggio's words in a letter to Sir George Beaumont, dated 28 August 1825, to describe his passion for planning the buildings and plantations of his Abbotsford estate. In his Life of Napoleon Buonaparte (1827-28), Scott also describes how the peace treaty between the French general and the Duke of Parma (1796) stipulated for the delivery to France of twenty masterpieces from the Duke's collections, including Correggio's 'St Jerome'. The Duke offered two million 'livres' in place of the Correggio, but Napoleon replied that the millions would soon be spent, whereas the painting would be an ornament to Paris for ages, and would inspire future masterpieces.

Robert Campbell, 1817 Silhouette portrait of Robert Campbell with pencilled inscription A silhouette portrait of the Scottish writer Robert Calder Campbell (1798-1857). An MS note on the back of this print tentatively identifies the sitter as Campbell. An accompanying note in typescript (possibly by J. C. Corson) observes that the sitter would appear to be at least a decade older than Campbell in 1817.

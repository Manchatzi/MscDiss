The Hon. Alexander Fraser Tytler, Lord Woodhouselee Engraved portrait of Alexander Fraser Tytler, Lord Woodhouselee, by C. Picart after J. Jackson after H. Raeburn Engraved half-length portrait of the Scottish historian Alexander Fraser Tytler, Lord Woodhouselee (1747-1813). Sir Walter Scott attended Alexander Fraser Tytler's courses in Universal History at Edinburgh University during the 1789-1790 session. Tytler's empiricism and his insistence on the determining influence of institutions, heredity, and environment had a profound impact on Scott's own vision of history. Scott was also greatly impressed by Tytler's translation of Schiller's Die Raíöuber (The Robbers) (1792) which inspired him to prepare his own translations of German drama and verse. Finally Tytler was sufficiently close a family friend to compose a Latin epitaph for Scott's dog Camp in 1809. The original portrait by Henry Raeburn was painted in 1804.

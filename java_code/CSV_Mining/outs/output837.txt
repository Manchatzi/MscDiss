Dryburgh Abbey: Burial Aisle of Sir W. Scott Engraving of St. Mary's Aisle and Dryburgh Abbey by J. Bower Depicts the ruins of Dryburgh Abbey, Scottish Borders, with St. Mary's Aisle in the midground. Sir Walter Scott was interred in St. Mary's Aisle on September 26, 1832. Scott lamented in his 'Autobiography' (1808) that, though his ancestors, the Haliburtons, once owned the Abbey, 'we have nothing left of Dryburgh... but the right of stretching our bones.' Scott's wife, Margaret Charlotte Carpenter, his eldest son, Walter Scott, and his son-in-law and biographer, J.G. Lockhart, are also buried here.    Dryburgh Abbey

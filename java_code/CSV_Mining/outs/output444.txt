Black: From a Picture by Jas. Heath after a Picture by Raeburn Steel engraved portrait of Joseph Black by J. Posselwhite after J. Heath after H. Raeburn Engraved portrait of the Scottish chemist and physicist Joseph Black (1728-1799). Black lived in the same building in College Wynd, Edinburgh, in which Sir Walter Scott was born. He has been credited with saving the infant Scott's life by informing his father that the child's nurse suffered from consumption. In Scott's novel Guy Mannering, Black is among the 'first literary characters of Scotland' to whom Counsellor Pleydell supplies Mannering with letters of introduction (ch. 10). The original portrait by Raeburn was painted ca. 1780 and the engraving by James Heath first published in 1800. The Portrait Gallery of Distinguished Poets vol. III. London: Wm. S.

[Engraving by W. Holl of a self-portrait by C. R. Leslie]  Engraved portrait of the Anglo-American painter Charles Robert Leslie (1794-1859). In September 1824, Leslie visited Abbotsford to paint a portrait of Scott which had been commissioned by the American academic Prof. George Ticknor. Leslie was also a prolific illustrator of Scott's works, contributing to The Novels and Tales of the Author of Waverley (1823), the 'Magnum Opus' edition of the Waverley Novels (1829-32), Charles Heath's Waverley Album (1832) and Portraits of the Principle Female Characters in the Waverley Novels (1833-34). In his General Preface to the 'Magnum Opus' edition of the Waverley Novels, Scott thanks Leslie for his efforts as an illustrator as 'a friend as well as an author'. While at Abbotsford he also painted Scott's factotum Tam Purdie. Leslie, C.R. Autobiographical Recollections. London: J. Murray, 1860 (front.)

Wellington: Copied by Permission of Mr. Graves from an Engraving by Mr. F.C. Lewis of a Drawing by Sir Thomas Lawrence Engraved portrait of the Duke of Wellington by H. Adlard after F.C. Lewis after T. Lawrence Engraved sketch portrait of the Duke of Wellington (1769-1852), with facsimile of signature. Sir Walter Scott was a great admirer of Wellington's generalship in the Peninsular War. In 1811 he declared Wellington 'the only man we had to trust to' (letter to John B.S. Morritt, 26 April). He was 'a man of genius and talent, not deterd [sic] by obstacles, not fettered by prejudices, not immured within the pedantries of his profession but playing the general and the heroe [sic] where most of our military commanders would have exhibited the drill Serjeant or at best the adjutant'. Scott celebrated Wellington's victories in The Vision of Don Roderick (1811) and The Field of Waterloo (1815). Scott met Wellington in Paris in 1815 and gave an account of their interview in Paul's Letters to His Kinsfolk, where the account of the Battle of Waterloo draws largely on Wellington's own account. Later, Wellington supplied notes on Napoleon's Russian campaign for Scott Life of Napoleon Bonaparte (1827-1828). Adlard's engraving is derived from an earlier print by Frederick Christian Lewis (1779-1856). The original drawing by Sir Thomas Lawrence was made c. 1820. Gleig, G.R.

Loch Awe (Argyleshire): From the Island of Fraoch Looking North Engraving of Loch Awe by J. Swan after J. Fleming Depicts Loch Awe (Argyll and Bute) and surrounding countryside. Loch Awe and its surrounding countryside feature in a number of Sir Walter Scott's works. 'The Highland Widow' (1827) is set on its banks. In 'Nora's Vow', translated from the Gaelic for Albyn's Anthology (published by Alexander Campbell in 1816), the heroine protests that she will never marry the Earl's son even if 'The Awe's fierce stream may backward turn, | Ben-Cruaichan fall, and crush Kilchurn' (III.3-4). Loch Awe also appears in A Legend of Montrose, ch. 17. In a letter to the painter Sir David Wilkie, dated 2 August 1817), Scott recommends that he 'visit the head of Loch Awe, which I look upon as equal to any thing in the Highlands' (Letters, IV, 484).

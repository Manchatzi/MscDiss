George Buchanan: From a Picture by Francis Pourbus Senr. in the Possession of the Royal Society Steel engraved portrait of George Buchanan by E. Scriven after a picture by F. Pourbus the elder Engraved portrait of the Scottish poet, historian and humanist scholar George Buchanan (1506-1582). In both his fictional and historical works, Sir Walter Scott drew extensively on Buchanan's Rerum Scoticarum Historia while treating its earlier chapters with some scepticism. Buchanan's histories and polemical treatises are a particularly important source for The Abbot (1820). Buchanan's role as tutor to King James VI and I is invoked in The Fortunes of Nigel (1822), especially his disapproval of the convention that a whipping boy (here Sir Mungo Malagrowther) suffer all punishments due to the King. There are further references to Buchanan in Waverley (where he is among the Baron of Bradwardine's favourite poets), The Monastery, and The Bride of Lammermoor. Buchanan was reputedly Scott's favourite Latin poet, although he found his Latin hymns less 'solemn and affecting' to his 'Gothic ear' than the Catholic liturgy (letter to Rev. George Crabbe, ca. January 1813). The Portrait Gallery of Distinguished Poets, vol. I. London: Wm. S. Orr & Co., 1853

Scene From Mount Pilate, Switzerland Engraving of Mount Pilatus by J. Cousen after C. Stanfield Presents a view of the Swiss Alps from Mount Pilatus. In Sir Walter Scott's Anne of Geierstein (1829), the exiled Lancastrians John de Vere, Earl of Oxford, and his son, Arthur, travel incognito through Switzerland on a mission to convert Charles the Bold, Duke of Burgundy, to the Lancastrian cause.

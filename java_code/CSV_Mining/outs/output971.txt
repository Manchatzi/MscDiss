Duchess of Newcastle Engraved title page and frontispiece of Scott's Peveril of the Peak Title page of Peveril of the Peak, volume XXIX of a set of the Waverley Novels published by A. & C. Black, depicting Margaret Cavendish, Duchess of Newcastle (1661-1717). In Walter Scott's Peveril of the Peak (1823), the Duchess of Newcastle is mentioned on several occasions as a friend of the Countess of Derby. She attracts the ridicule of the Earl of Derby and of King Charles II who describes her as 'an entire raree-show in her own person--a universal masquerade--indeed a sort of private Bedlam-hospital' (ch. 45). To this day, the Duchess divides opinion, some hailing her as a pioneering woman writer, others concurring with Pepys that she was 'mad, conceited and ridiculous'. Scott clearly inclined to the latter view. The original wood engraving, probably by John Thompson, was made for the Abbotsford Edition of the Waverley Novels (1842-47). It derives, probably via earlier engravings, from an original painting by Abraham Diepenbeeck. Scott, W. Peveril of the Peak. Edinburgh: Adam and Charles Black, [185-?]    Popish Plot, 1678

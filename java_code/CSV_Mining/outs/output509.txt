Grotius: From an Original Picture by M.J. Mirevelt in the Possession of the Publisher Steel engraved portrait of Grotius by J. Posselwhite after a painting by M. J. van Miereveld Engraved portrait of the Dutch jurist and scholar Hugo Grotius (1583-1645). In chapter 1 of A Legend of Montrose (1819), Sir Walter Scott quotes Grotius's condemnation of mercenaries: 'Nullum vitae genus est improbius, quam eorum, qui sine causae respectu mercede conducti, militant' ('There is no more immoral way of life than that of these men who, regardless of the cause, fight for money'). Equally, when in Old Mortality (1816), James Graham of Claverhouse laments the Covenanters' contempt for the 'laws of war', he is referring to Grotius's De jure belli ac pacis libri (1625). In a letter to his son Captain Walter Scott of 25 December 1827, Scott hopes that his younger son Charles is busy studying 'Grotius, Puffendorf and others of that class of jurists' in order to obtain a post at the Foreign Office. The original portrait by Miereveld was painted in 1614. The Portrait Gallery of Distinguished Poets, vol. I. London: Wm. S. Orr & Co., 1853

Scott replied: 'If Addison's slippers and wig-box will serve you in your professional dress, pray accept them from me, for my curiosity leads chiefly to articles of armour; and Addison, I know not why, is personally no such favourite of mine as Sir Roger de Coverley should make him' (letter of 15 June 1819). (Sir Roger de Coverley was a caricatural old country gentlemen created by Addison in The Spectator.) Despite his expressed distaste for Addison, Scott frequently quoted his works, particularly the tragedy Cato which he saw performed in Edinburgh in 1812, greatly admiring J. P. Kemble in the title role. The original portrait was painted by Sir Godfrey Kneller (1646-1723) between 1703 and 1712.

In 1815 he twice invited Scott to dine with him and granted him free access to the Regent's Library, where Scott consulted papers on the Jacobite Rebellions of 1715 and 1745-46. In 1818 Scott became the first man to be knighted under George IV and the first ever to be knighted in recognition of literary merit. When the new king commissioned Sir Thomas Lawrence to paint the most distinguished men of the age for the great gallery at Windsor Castle, he desired that Scott be foremost amongst the men of science and letters. For his part, Scott played a leading role in organizing the visit of King George IV to Edinburgh in 1822, the first visit of a Hanoverian monarch to Scotland.

A two-storey manor house (portrayed here) was built in its stead. Scott continued to live in Abbotsford following the financial disaster of 1825-26 as the estate had been settled upon his newly married son Walter.

The campaign against the Covenanters, conducted by Graham of Claverhouse, is the subject of Walter Scott's Old Mortality (1816). In a footnote to the Magnum Opus edition of the novel (1830), Scott writes: 'This remarkable person united the seemingly inconsistent qualities of courage and cruelty, a disinterested and devoted loyalty to his prince, with a disregard of the rights of his fellow-subjects. He was the unscrupulous agent of the Scottish Privy Council in executing the merciless severities of the government in Scotland during the reigns of Charles II. and James II.; but he redeemed his character by the zeal with which he asserted the cause of the latter monarch after the Revolution, the military skill with which he supported it at the battle of Killiecrankie, and by his own death in the arms of victory.' Scott was fascinated by the figure of Claverhouse, whom he believed had been traduced by Presbyterian historians, and displayed a portrait of him in his study at Castle Street, Edinburgh. Claverhouse is also portrayed in 'Wandering Willie's Tale' (1824) and in the song 'Bonnie Dundee' in Scott's play The Doom of Devorgoil (1830).",Colour Lithograph/Lithograph,Lithograph,"22.8 x 33.6cm (9"" x 1' 1 1/4"")",Ink,Paper,,,,,Color Lithography/Lithography,TBC/Main Library/Special Collections,Corson Collection,"Albert, C.

Over the following decades, their whereabouts was forgotten, and it was rumoured that, counter to the terms of the Union, they had been carried away to England. Prompted by Sir Walter Scott, the Prince Regent set up a commission to search the Crown Room for the Regalia. On 4 February 1818, the Commissioners, including Scott, discovered the chest and found, wrapped in linen, the fourteenth-century Scottish Crown, the Sceptre of James V, and the Sword of State, a gift from Pope Julius II to James V. The Regalia were subsequently placed on permanent display in the Crown Room.

When Scott bought the 110-acre Cartley Hole Farm in 1811 he renamed it Abbotsford. He bought up neighbouring properties until in 1825 the estate had expanded to ten times its original size. By 1821, the residence that he had built between 1812 and 1818 had become too small for the estate and for the constant stream of visitors that he received. A two-storey manor house (portrayed here) was built in its stead.

It depicts Rebecca as described in chapter 7 of the novel: 'Her form was exquisitely symmetrical, and was shown to advantage by a sort of Eastern dress, which she wore according to the fashion of the females of her nation. Her turban of yellow silk suited well with the darkness of her complexion. The brilliancy of her eyes, the superb arch of her eyebrows, her well-formed aquiline nose, her teeth as white as pearl, and the profusion of her sable tresses, which, each arranged in its own little spiral of twisted curls, fell down upon as much of a lovely neck and bosom as a simarre of the richest Persian silk, exhibiting flowers in their natural colours embossed upon a purple ground, permitted to be visible--all these constituted a combination of loveliness, which yielded not to the most beautiful of the maidens who surrounded her. It is true, that of the golden and pearl-studded clasps, which closed her vest from the throat to the waist, the three uppermost were left unfastened on account of the heat, which something enlarged the prospect to which we allude. A diamond necklace, with pendants of inestimable value, were by this means also made more conspicuous.

Scott began his literary career with a series of translations from contemporary German literature. Of Goethe, the European writer whom Scott most admired, he translated Goetz of Berlichingen (1799), 'The Erl-King' (1799), 'Frederick and Alice' (1800), and 'Lamentation of the Faithful Wife of Asan Aga' (1806). Scott described Goethe as 'a wonderful fellow, the Ariosto at once, and almost the Voltaire of Germany' (Journal, 15 February 1827) and acclaimed him as 'an author born to arouse the slumbering fame of his country' (Introduction to 'Magnum' edition of Anne of Geierstein, 1831). Scott was bitterly disappointed that Goethe's death on 22 March 1832 thwarted a long-cherished plan to visit him at Weimar. Goethe, in his turn, was a great admirer of the Waverley Novels, praising Scott in a letter of 12 January 1827 for his 'wonderful pictures of human life'. Deeply flattered, Scott sent Goethe a copy of his Life of Napoleon Buonaparte and hailed him as 'the father of the German literature' (letter of 9 July 1827).",Book,Book,"20.4 x 12.2cm (8 1/16 x 4 13/16"")",Ink,Paper,,,,,Printing,TBC/Main Library/Special Collections,Corson Collection,"Goethe, J.W.

When Charles Montagu-Scott, 4th Duke of Buccleuch, asked for a portrait of Scott, he recommended Allan, describing him as a 'man of real genius' who had made 'one or two glorious portraits' (letter of 15 April 1819). The Duke opted for Raeburn, but Allan went on to paint a number of portraits of Scott and of his family, notably one of Scott's son, Walter, in his full Hussar uniform (1821). Besides a number of historical paintings inspired by Scott's works, Allan was responsible for Illustrations of the Novels and Tales of the Author of Waverley (Edinburgh: Archibald Constable, 1820). Allan's friendship with Scott lasted until the writer's dying day when Allan was the only non-family member present at Abbotsford.

Over dinner with Captain Edward Cheney in Frascati on 1 May 1832, Scott claimed to read it once a year. At Edinburgh University he outraged his Greek professor by submitting an essay in which he argued that Ariosto was superior to Homer. While a college student, Scott took private Italian lessons to be able to read Ariosto, Tasso, and Boiardo in the original. Scott gave Edward Waverley, hero of his first novel (1814), much of his own love of Italian Romance. Francis Osbaldistone too in Rob Roy (1817) courts Diana Vernon by reading his translation of the first books of the Orlando furioso (ch. 16).

Here Scott identifies the reign of James I and VI as a critical moment of transition from the Age of Chivalry to the Age of Reason: 'The hour was already arrived when Bacon was about to teach the world that they were no longer to reason from authority to fact, but to establish truth by advancing from fact to fact, till they fixed an indisputable authority, not from hypothesis, but from experiment.' A further significant citation occurs in 'The Two Drovers' (1827), where the judge at the trial of Robin Oig M'Combich quotes Bacon's view of revenge as 'a kind of wild, untutored justice'. Scott also cites Bacon's views on astrology in Guy Mannering (1815) and Letters on Demonology and Witchcraft (1830).

Sir Walter Scott was a great admirer of Joanna Baillie's blank verse Plays of the Passions, considering her 'the best dramatic writer whom Britain has produced since the days of Shakespeare and Massinger' (letter to Sarah Smith, 4 March 1808). He was first introduced to her at her Hampstead home in 1806, and the pair became lifelong friends and devoted correspondents. Scott found her 'the only writing lady with whose manners in society I have been very much delighted' (letter to Lady Abercorn, 18 September 1811). As a Trustee of Edinburgh Theatre, Scott played an active role in organizing a highly successful production of Baillie's The Family Legend and a revival of her De Montfort in 1810. Scott's own drama Halidon Hill began life as a contribution to Joanna Baillie's Collection of Poetical Miscellanies. When it grew too large for the anthology, it was replaced by a shorter dramatic sketch MacDuff's Cross. Baillie had earlier contributed verse to Scott's anthology English Minstrelsy (1810). The original portrait by Masquerier was painted in 1812.

The Factor had reputedly sent the skeleton of a porpoise to Banks in the belief that it was a mermaid. When Banks attempted to disabuse him, the Factor opined that the distinguished naturalist was an 'auld blind doited deevil'. Scott relates a similar anecdote in a note to the Magnum Opus Edition of The Pirate (1831) recalling how a supposed sea-serpent was washed up on the shore of Shetland and sent to Banks for examination.

On 17 February 1823, Bentham wrote to Samuel Parr describing an engraving by Robert Bowyer of George Hayter's painting View of the Interior of the House of Lords during the Trial of Queen Caroline, 1820. Among the audience, Hayter had portrayed many public figures of the day, placing Bentham, to his dismay, next to Sir Walter Scott 'the servile poet and novelist'. Scott never mentioned Bentham by name but, both explicitly in his political pamphlets and implicitly in his novels, he attacked his projects for juridical reform which he feared would destroy national characteristics and traditions. When both men died in close proximity in 1832, obituarists presented them as figureheads of the two opposing currents of nineteenth-century thought: Utilitarianism and Romanticism. The original portrait by George Frederick Watts (not 'J. Watts' as indicated in the caption) was taken in 1837 from Bentham's 'Auto-Icon' (now on display at University College London).",Engraving,Engraving,"18.4 x 26.9cm (7 1/4 x 10 9/16"")",Ink,Paper,,,,,Steel Engraving,TBC/Main Library/Special Collections,Corson Collection,"The Portrait Gallery of Distinguished Poets, vol.

There are further references to Buchanan in Waverley (where he is among the Baron of Bradwardine's favourite poets), The Monastery, and The Bride of Lammermoor.

When asked by James Ballantyne how he ranked his own genius next to Burns, Scott replied: 'There is no comparison whatever -- we ought not to be named in the same day.' Scott met Burns only once at the age of fifteen in 1787 at Sciennes Hill House, Edinburgh, an event he frequently recalled. Besides copious quotations from Burns in his published works and letters, Scott included ballads collected by Burns in his Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border (1802-1803). He provided his son-in-law J. G. Lockhart with letters and reminiscences for his Life of Burns (1828) and approved of Lockhart's decision to gloss over the poet's perceived moral failings.

Visiting Paris in 1815, he admired the three Canovas commissioned by the Empress Josephine for the Malmaison (now in the Hermitage, St Petersburg). His Paul's Letters to his Kinsfolk (1816) records that he was 'particularly struck' by the Dancer with her Hand on her Hip. When in Rome in April 1832, the dying Scott most wished to see Canova's Cenotaph of the Stuarts erected in St Peter's at the expense of George IV. The following month he admired Canova's Venere Italica in the Palazzo Pitti in Florence. He also mentioned Canova's Venus Victrix in his Life of Napoleon Buonaparte (1827-28), commenting that Pauline Bonaparte's 'encouragement of the fine arts was so little limited by the ordinary ideas of decorum' that she permitted the sculptor to use her as the model. There is a single reference to Canova in the Waverly Novels. In chapter 12 of Saint Ronan's Well (1824) Valentine Bulmer declares that Clare Mowbray's pallor renders her more interesting: 'The last time I saw her, I thought she might have rivalled one of Canova's finest statues.'

Over dinner with Captain Edward Cheney in Frascati on 1 May 1832, Scott claimed that it was Cervantes who first inspired in him the desire to excel in fiction. Indeed in the opening section of his first novel Waverley (1814), Scott hails Cervantes as his most significant predecessor while underlining his own innovations on his model: 'From the minuteness with which I have traced Waverley's pursuits,and the bias which these unavoidably communicated to his imagination, the reader may perhaps anticipate, in the following tale, an imitation of the romance of Cervantes. But he will do my prudence injustice in the supposition. My intention is not to follow the steps of that inimitable author, in describing such total perversion of intellect as misconstrues the objects actually presented to the senses, but that more common aberration from sound judgment, which apprehends occurrences indeed in their reality, but communicates to them a tincture of its own romantic tone and colouring.' (ch. 5) While studying at Edinburgh University Scott acquired sufficient Spanish to read Cervantes in the original. His works are saturated with references to Don Quixote and the Novelas ejemplares. The Tales of a Landlord each bear an epitaph from Don Quixote. The 'Introductory Epistle' to The Monastery (1820) cites Don Quixote as an example of the dangers of anonymous authorship, inspiring, like Scott's own novels, sequels from unscrupulous rivals. In the 'Introductory Address' to Count Robert of Paris and Castle Dangerous (1832), Scott's last published works, Scott again cites Cervantes's self-defence against critics who highlighted minor inconsistencies and loose ends in his narrative. The importance of Cervantes is also repeatedly acknowledged in Lives of the Novelists (1821-24) and the 'Essay on Chivalry' (1818).

Only one encounter between Scott and Chalmers has been recorded. At the Annual Meeting of the School of Arts on 1 June 1824 Chalmers moved the approval of the Annual Report, expressing an essentially paternalistic vision of the relationship between the school and its working-class pupils. Scott seconded the motion, warmly applauding the principles underpinning Chalmers's speech. See William Hanna, Memoirs of the Life and Writings of Thomas Chalmers (New York: Harper, 1857), vol.

Sir Walter Scott records in his Journal that on 24 May 1828 the former Prime Minister Henry Addington, 1st Viscount Sidmouth showed him correspondence between Pitt the Elder and Anthony Addington (the Pitt family's physician and Sidmouth's father). Scott finds that Pitt's 'handwriting is strong and bold, and his expressions short and manly'. He notes many 'intimations of his partiality' for his son William and Pitt's concern for William's mania to copy him in all things. Comparing the correspondence of the two William Pitts, Scott reflects that Pitt the Younger lacked the 'lofty ideas' of his father, as evidenced in his very handwriting. He particularly contrasts Pitt the Elder's vigorous prosecution of war with France with Pitt the Younger's pacific instincts and tendency to underfund the armed forces, a point that Scott has previously made in his Life of Napoleon Buonaparte (1827-28). In 'The Highland Widow' (1827) Chatham is also praised for entrusting the defence of the colonies to Highlanders 'who, until his time, had been the objects of doubt, fear, and suspicion, on the part of each successive administration'.

Chaucer is frequently cited throughout Scott's works, particularly as an authoritative source on medieval life and manners. In Peveril of the Peak (ch. 21) and Woodstock (ch. 16), Scott introduces Chaucer enthusiasts who lament the neglect into which the poet has fallen. Chaucer's unpopularity continued into Scott's day, his project of a hundred-volume edition of the British poets foundering upon his insistence that it begin with Chaucer. A correspondent, Anna Seward, even wrote that Dryden, Spencer, and Chaucer seems to her 'overpraised' and that 'not one of them equals yourself or Southey' (29 January 1807). Scott replied that 'My admiration of Chaucer Spenser and Dryden does not blind me to their faults for I see the coarsness [sic] of the first the tediousness occasiond [sic] by the continued allegory of the second and the inequalities of the last but my dear Miss Seward ""in these days were giants in the land"" and we are but dwarfs beside them' (20 February 1807).

Despite being 'surrounded by the worst possible models', he 'vanquished the taste of his age, the competition of his rivals, and the envy of Richelieu'. Scott nonetheless regrets that in his own 'Essay on Dramatic Poetry', Corneille helped to impose the observance of the unities on future generations of French dramatists, even though they had at times forced him to 'violate the rules of probability and common sense'. In his essay on 'MoliÌ¬re' (1828), Scott considered the differences between the French classical tragedy of Corneille and Racine and the English tragedy of Shakespeare, and analysed the radically differing tastes of French and English audiences. In his The Life of Napoleon Bonaparte (1827-28), Scott attributed Napoleon's preference for Racine and Corneille over Voltaire to the fact that 'they wrote their immortal works for the meridian of a court, and at the command of the most monarchical of monarchs, Louis XIV'. Unlike Voltaire, their masterpieces contain 'nothing that can wound the ear of the most sensitive sovereign'.

In Letters on Demonology and Witchcraft (1830), Scott cites an episode in the life of the conquistador HernÌÁn CortÌ©s (or CortÌ©z) as an instance of the 'infectious character of superstition'. According to Bernal Diíaz del Castillo's Historia verdadera de la Nueva EspaníÄa, CortÌ©s did not himself see a vision of Saint Iago on a white horse which appeared to his soldiers and urged them on to a victory against great odds. Instead he saw a cavalier, named Francisco de Morla, mounted on a chestnut horse. Rather than concluding, however, that the vision was a figment of the collective imagination, CortÌ©s exclaimed: 'Sinner that I am, what am I that I should have beheld the blessed apostle!' There are further references to CortÌ©s in Rokeby (1813) and The Pirate (1821). In canto I, stanza 12 of the former Bertram Risingham describes the Battle of Marston Moor. If he had led such valiant men, he exclaims, he would not have sought 'El Dorados in the sky' but would have outstripped the conquests of CortÌ©s and Pizarro (lines 19-28). In chapter 4 of The Pirate, Scott remarks that the Scottish plough that Triptolemus Yellowly seeks attempts to introduce to Shetland would seem stranger to a modern Scottish farmer 'than the corslets and casques of the soldiers of Cortes might seem to a regiment of our soldiers'.

According to Basil Hall's Fragments of Voyages and Travels (1834), when sailing from Portsmouth Harbour in 1831, Scott asked to be shown the spot where the HMS Royal George was accidentally sunk. Scott then quoted the following lines from Cowper's 'Loss of the Royal George': 'His sword was in its sheath | His fingers held the pen, | Where Kempenfield went down | With twice four hundred men.'

While a college student, Scott took private Italian lessons to be able to read Ariosto, Tasso, Boiardo, and Dante in the original. His admiration for Dante, however, was always qualified. Discussing the Inferno with Anna Seward, Scott complained that 'the plan appeared to him unhappy; the personal malignity and strange mode of revenge presumptuous and uninteresting'. In Italy in 1832, he told Captain Edward Cheney that he found Dante too obscure and difficult and thought it 'mortifying that Dante seemed to think nobody worth being sent to hell but his own Italians, whereas other people had every bit as great rogues in their families, whose misdeeds were suffered to pass with impunity'. Scott had forgotten that Dante had damned his own ancestor, the wizard Michael Scott. In chapter 12 of Rob Roy (1817), Diana Vernon seeks a pretext for a private interview with Frank Osbaldistone and asks for help deciphering a 'difficult passage' in the 'obscure Florentine's Divine Comedy. Frank's rival Rashleigh offers to accompany them as he is 'something better skilled [...] at tracking the sense of Dante through the metaphors and elisions of his wild and gloomy poem'.

Scott edited the first collection of Defoe's novels for the Ballantyne Press (1809-10) and assembled many of his anonymous tracts in his edition of the Somers Tracts (1809-15). For Miscellaneous Prose Works of Sir Walter Scott (1827), Scott added extensive critical remarks to the biographical sketch co-written with John Ballantyne that preceded his edition of Defoe's novels. This influential essay ascribed Defoe's appeal to 'the unequalled dexterity with which our author has given an appearance of REALITY to the incidents which he narrates'. Defoe's influence on Scott has been observed particularly in Old Mortality (1816), Rob Roy (1817), and The Pirate (1821).

Scott immersed himself in the literary and controversial writings of Dryden's age, and his edition provides a vivid picture of Restoration England. It is prefaced by a 'Life of Dryden' in which Scott praises the poet for the 'power of ratiocination, of investigating, discovering, and appreciating that which is really excellent [...] accompanied with the necessary command of fanciful illustration and elegant expression'. Scott placed Dryden behind only Shakespeare and Milton, but argued that he excelled both in versatility and had 'no equal' as a lyric poet. No other writer is quoted as frequently as Dryden in Scott's published works. Dryden's dramas also influenced Scott's own portrayal of seventeenth-century England, particularly Absalom and Achitopel, which informs the portrayal of Charles II and his favourite Buckingham in Peveril of the Peak (1823).",Engraving,Engraving,"18.3 x 26.8cm (7 3/16 x 10 9/16"")",Ink,Paper,,,,,Steel Engraving,TBC/Main Library/Special Collections,Corson Collection,"The Portrait Gallery of Distinguished Poets, vol.

In a footnote to the Magnum Opus edition of the novel (1830), Scott writes: 'This remarkable person united the seemingly inconsistent qualities of courage and cruelty, a disinterested and devoted loyalty to his prince, with a disregard of the rights of his fellow-subjects. He was the unscrupulous agent of the Scottish Privy Council in executing the merciless severities of the government in Scotland during the reigns of Charles II. and James II.; but he redeemed his character by the zeal with which he asserted the cause of the latter monarch after the Revolution, the military skill with which he supported it at the battle of Killiecrankie, and by his own death in the arms of victory.' Scott was fascinated by the figure of Claverhouse, whom he believed had been traduced by Presbyterian historians, and displayed a portrait of him in his study at Castle Street, Edinburgh.

In Kenilworth (1821), the pedantic schoolmaster Erasmus Holiday derives his name 'partly from his father having been the son of a renowned washerwoman, who had held that great scholar in clean linen all the while he was at Oxford' and partly due to 'the secret presentiment of his mother's mind that, in the babe to be christened, was a hidden genius, which should one day lead him to rival the fame of the great scholar of Amsterdam' (ch. 9). In Anne of Geierstein (1829), the description of a German tavern and of 15th-century Germany manners is derived, without acknowledgment, from Erasmus's dialogue Diversoria (ch. 19).

When, in 1806, Scott's political patron Henry Dundas, 1st Viscount Melville, was acquitted of misappropriation of public funds, Sir Walter Scott composed a celebratory song which mocked Melville's Whig opponents Samuel Whitbread and Charles James Fox: 'But the Brewer we'll hoax, | Tallyho to the Fox, | And drink MELVILLE for ever, as long as we live!' ('Health to Lord Melville', lines 82-84). These lines, composed when Fox was gravely ill, gave serious offence to his supporters and cost Scott the friendship of Dugald Stewart and the Countess of Rosslyn. Scott made partial amends by praising Fox's patriotism in the Introduction to Canto I of Marmion (1808): 'When Europe crouch'd to France's yoke, | And Austria bent, and Prussia broke, | And the firm Russian's purpose brave, | Was barter'd by a timorous slave, | Even then dishonour's peace he spurn'd, | The sullied olive-branch return'd, | Stood for his country's glory fast, | And nail'd her colours to the mast!' (lines 154-161). In the Introduction to the 1830 edition of Marmion, Scott recalls his reluctance to appeal to Fox to sort out a clerical error jeopardizing his appointment as Principal Clerk to the Court of Session. He feared that it might appear an expression of 'political opinions different from those which I have always professed', although 'in his private capacity, there is no man to whom I would have been more proud to owe an obligation'. Scott was also told that Fox admired his Lay of the Last Minstrel (1805), and wrote: 'Although my Tory principles prevent my coinciding with his political opinions, I am very proud of his approbation in a literary sense' (letter to George Ellis, 26 May 1805).

When, in 1806, Scott's political patron Henry Dundas, 1st Viscount Melville, was acquitted of misappropriation of public funds, Sir Walter Scott composed a celebratory song which mocked Melville's Whig opponents Samuel Whitbread and Charles James Fox: 'But the Brewer we'll hoax, | Tallyho to the Fox, | And drink MELVILLE for ever, as long as we live!' ('Health to Lord Melville', lines 82-84). These lines, composed when Fox was gravely ill, gave serious offence to his supporters and cost Scott the friendship of Dugald Stewart and the Countess of Rosslyn. Scott made partial amends by praising Fox's patriotism in the Introduction to Canto I of Marmion (1808): 'When Europe crouch'd to France's yoke, | And Austria bent, and Prussia broke, | And the firm Russian's purpose brave, | Was barter'd by a timorous slave, | Even then dishonour's peace he spurn'd, | The sullied olive-branch return'd, | Stood for his country's glory fast, | And nail'd her colours to the mast!' (lines 154-161). In the Introduction to the 1830 edition of Marmion, Scott recalls his reluctance to appeal to Fox to sort out a clerical error jeopardizing his appointment as Principal Clerk to the Court of Session. He feared that it might appear an expression of 'political opinions different from those which I have always professed', although 'in his private capacity, there is no man to whom I would have been more proud to owe an obligation'. Scott was also told that Fox admired his Lay of the Last Minstrel (1805), and wrote: 'Although my Tory principles prevent my coinciding with his political opinions, I am very proud of his approbation in a literary sense' (letter to George Ellis, 26 May 1805).

Sir Walter Scott's first novel Waverley (1814) is set during the Jacobite Rebellion of 1745-46 which sought to place Charles Edward Stewart on the British throne in place of the Hanoverian George II. The hero, Edward Waverley, is arrested on a charge of 'levying war against the king, the highest delinquency of which a subject can be guilty' (ch. 31). A further fictional rebellion against George II is described in Redgauntlet (1824). Here the ultimate failure of the Jacobite cause is proved by the reading of George II's personal orders to let the conspirators return in peace to the Continent (ch. 23). The Jacobite Rebellions are also described in Tales of a Grandfather, Third Series (1829), where Scott terms Georges I and II 'men of honour, courage, and good sense; but, being born and educated foreigners [...] strangers to the peculiar character, no less than to the very complicated form of government, of the country over which they were called by Providence to reign'. Despite Scott's insistence on George II's 'good sense', there are references in The Heart of Mid-Lothian (1818) to his notorious temper. Miss Damahoy has heard 'that King George flang his periwig in the fire when he heard o' the Porteous mob', kicked Sir Robert Walpole, and, according to Bartholomew Saddletree 'was for kicking the Duke of Argylle too'. Miss Damahoy concludes that 'he might keep mair wit in his anger' (ch. 23). In the same novel Jeanie Deans successfully pleads with Queen Caroline to intercede with George II to pardon her sister Effie.

George IV, both as Prince Regent and King, bestowed a number of favours upon Sir Walter Scott. In 1813 he offered Scott the post of Poet Laureate (which Scott refused in favour of Robert Southey). In 1815 he twice invited Scott to dine with him and granted him free access to the Regent's Library, where Scott consulted papers on the Jacobite Rebellions of 1715 and 1745-46. In 1818 Scott became the first man to be knighted under George IV and the first ever to be knighted in recognition of literary merit. When the new king commissioned Sir Thomas Lawrence to paint the most distinguished men of the age for the great gallery at Windsor Castle, he desired that Scott be foremost amongst the men of science and letters. For his part, Scott played a leading role in organizing the visit of King George IV to Edinburgh in 1822, the first visit of a Hanoverian monarch to Scotland.

Scott described Goethe as 'a wonderful fellow, the Ariosto at once, and almost the Voltaire of Germany' (Journal, 15 February 1827) and acclaimed him as 'an author born to arouse the slumbering fame of his country' (Introduction to 'Magnum' edition of Anne of Geierstein, 1831). Scott was bitterly disappointed that Goethe's death on 22 March 1832 thwarted a long-cherished plan to visit him at Weimar. Goethe, in his turn, was a great admirer of the Waverley Novels, praising Scott in a letter of 12 January 1827 for his 'wonderful pictures of human life'.

Scott sought unsuccessfully to use his influence to have Grahame elected to the Lectureship of St George's Chapel, Edinburgh, in October 1808. On his death in 1811, Scott lamented him as 'one good man lost to the best of possible worlds' who 'had conscience and modesty enough for a whole General Assembly or Convocation' (letter to Charles Kirkpatrick Sharpe, 4 December 1811). He regretted however that his 'principles and prejudices and feelings made an odd jumble', hampering both his legal and ecclesiastical careers. He was a Jacobite yet a Whig, an Anglican yet an apologist for the Covenanters. Scott recalled teasing him for his detestation of his own kinsman John Graham of Claverhouse.

Hampden was staunchly opposed to autocratic rule of Charles I, particularly the King's attempts to levy the 'ship money' tax. There are several references to Hampden in Scott's novels of 17th-century England and Scotland. In Old Mortality (1816), the putative narrator Peter Pattieson writes that many Covenanters 'united the independent sentiments of a Hampden with the suffering zeal of a Hooper or Latimer' (ch. 1). In Woodstock (1826), the hostility of the wolfhound Bevis to the fugitive Charles II leads the King to believe that 'the spirit of Pym or Hampden has transmigrated into the rogue and continues to demonstrate his hatred against royalty and all its adherents' (ch. 24). In an Appendix to the Introduction to the 'Magnum Opus' edition of Peveril of the Peak (1831), Scott writes that 'the adventures ascribed to ""historical characters"" would, however, fail in their moral aim, if fiction were placed at variance with truth; if Hampden or Sydney, for example, were painted as swindlers'. Finally, a note to the 'Magnum' edition of Ivanhoe (1830) reveals that Scott borrowed his hero's name 'from a manor forfeited by the ancestor of the celebrated Hampden, for striking the Black Prince a blow with his racket, when they quarrelled at tennis'.",Engraving,Engraving,"18 x 23.8cm (7 1/16 x 9 3/8"")",Ink,Paper,,,,,Steel Engraving,TBC/Main Library/Special Collections,Corson Collection,"The Portrait Gallery of Distinguished Poets, vol.

Sir Walter Scott was, by his own admission, no connoisseur of music. When his wife Charlotte attended the Edinburgh Music Festival in 1815, the highlight of which was a performance of Handel's Messiah, Scott preferred to stay at Abbotsford. He wrote that he was 'delighted with your having found the gaieties of the time acceptable' but that he would not 'give one ""wheeble of a whaup"" from the moss at Keaside for all the fine music you have heard' (letter of 11 November 1805). Scott nonetheless named Handel as pre-eminent in the art of music in his Life of Dryden (1808), where Handel's setting of Dryden's 'Alexander's Feast' is discussed. Handel is also quoted as identifying the morris dance as the quintessential English dance in a note to the Magnum Opus edition of The Fair Maid of Perth (1832).

Scott was particularly hurt by his critique of Marmion (1808), feeling that it might have been couched 'in language rather more civil to a personal friend'. While entertaining the highest regard for Jeffrey's talents, Scott felt he lacked 'the taste for poetry which is essentially necessary to enjoy and of course to criticize it with justice', and specifically 'that enthusiastic feeling which like sun-shine upon a landscape lights up every beauty and palliates if it cannot hide ever defect' (letter to Joanna Baillie, 31 October 1808).

His support was thus essential when Scott applied for and obtained the posts of Sheriff-Depute of Selkirkshire (1799) and Principal Clerk to the Court of Session (1806). Lord and Lady Melville also became close friends of the Scotts. They had been Scott's childhood neighbours in George Square, Edinburgh, and Melville Castle was situated close to Scott's summer home of Lasswade. When Lord Melville was impeached for financial mismanagement in 1804, Scott composed two songs in celebration of his acquittal which were sung by James Ballantyne at a public dinner in Melville's honour.

Here Scott expressed his support for Montgomery's cause, and wrote that he had had the chimneys at Abbotsford made circular and smooth so that they could be cleaned by a 'simple machine', rather than a child (letter to James Montgomery, January 4, 1824). Montgomery, who published a critical account of Marmion in The Critical Review (1808) considered Scott 'an admirable writer' except when he dealt with modern subjects: 'in his magic circle he is inimitable - out of it, a gentleman who writes with ease' (quoted in Helen C. Knight's Life of James Montgomery (1857), p. 133).

Inspired by Alexander Fraser Tytler's translation of Schiller's drama Die RÌ_uber, Scott prepared his own version of Schiller's Die VerschwÌ¦rung des Fiesco zu Genoa. The manuscript is now lost but Scott recalled that he 'used to read it to sobbing and weeping audiences & no wonder, for whatever may be thought of the translation the original is sublime' (letter to Mary Anne Hughes, 13 December 1821). Scott also wrote a play The House of Aspen in imitation of Schiller, which he later dismissed as 'a sort of half-mad German tragedy which I wrote many years ago when my taste was very green and when like the rest of the world I was taken in with the bombast of Schiller' (letter to Lady Abercorn, 17 May 1811).

He was 'a man of genius and talent, not deterd [sic] by obstacles, not fettered by prejudices, not immured within the pedantries of his profession but playing the general and the heroe [sic] where most of our military commanders would have exhibited the drill Serjeant or at best the adjutant'. Scott celebrated Wellington's victories in The Vision of Don Roderick (1811) and The Field of Waterloo (1815). Scott met Wellington in Paris in 1815 and gave an account of their interview in Paul's Letters to His Kinsfolk, where the account of the Battle of Waterloo draws largely on Wellington's own account.

Sir Walter Scott was a friend and admirer of Wordsworth. They first met when Scott accompanied the poet and his sister on a tour of the Border Country in September 1803. Scott visited the Wordsworths at Grasmere in August 1805 and climbed Helvellyn with Wordsworth and Sir Humphry Davey. A further visit to Grasmere took place in August 1825. Finally, the Wordsworths visited Abbotsford in 1831, leading Wordsworth to compose 'On the Departure of Sir Walter Scott from Abbotsford, for Naples'. Writing of Wordsworth, Scott declared that he did not know 'a man more to be venerated for uprightness of heart and loftiness of genius' (letter to Allan Cunningham, 7 January 1821). His conversation 'as much distinguished by manly sense and candour as by talent and principle, was like a fountain in the desert' (letter to Sir George Beaumont, 28 August 1825). Scott, who particularly admired Wordsworth's sonnets, regretted that his poetry was not as popular as it deserved to be as it was 'too subtle and metaphysical in the idea, & too blunt in the expression' (letter to Allan Cunningham, 14 October 1828).

Following the Act of Union between England and Scotland in 1707, the ancient Regalia (or 'Honours') of Scotland were deposited in a locked oak chest in the Crown Room of Edinburgh Castle. Over the following decades, their whereabouts was forgotten, and it was rumoured that, counter to the terms of the Union, they had been carried away to England. Prompted by Sir Walter Scott, the Prince Regent set up a commission to search the Crown Room for the Regalia. On 4 February 1818, the Commissioners, including Scott, discovered the chest and found, wrapped in linen, the fourteenth-century Scottish Crown, the Sceptre of James V, and the Sword of State, a gift from Pope Julius II to James V. The Regalia were subsequently placed on permanent display in the Crown Room. Scott described the discovery in his Description of the Regalia of Scotland (1819).

Scott's first aborted attempt to write a prose romance Thomas the Rhymer revolved around the legend that a cavern existed beneath the Eildon Hills, where King Arthur and his knights lay sleeping (see the General Introduction to the Waverley Novels (1829)). The Hills are mentioned in numerous other works by Scott, notably 'The Eve of St John' (1799).

The music was selected from four Rossini operas, Semiramide, MosÌ¬, Tancredi, and La gazza ladra, and arranged by Antonio Pacini. Scott himself was in the audience for the 31 October performance and wrote in his Journal: 'It was superbly got up, the Norman soldiers wearing pointed helmets and what resembled much hauberks of mail, which looked very well.

The chapel, a 15th-century building located 9 miles south of Edinburgh, is also described in Scott's Provincial Antiquities & Picturesque Scenery of Scotland (1826) and is thought to have provided the model for the convent of Engaddi in The Talisman (1825). Its architecture inspired the rich moulded ceiling of the library at Scott's home of Abbotsford.

The Battle of Prestonpans (September 21, 1745) saw Charles Edward Stuart's Jacobite army defeat Sir John Cope's Hanoverian troups. It is depicted in Sir Walter Scott's novel Waverley (1814), where the eponymous hero deserts Colonel Gardiner's Hanoverian dragoons to join the Jacobites. Scott thus describes the fall of Gardiner (a real-life figure): 'Waverley, as he cast his eyes towards this scene of smoke and slaughter, observed Colonel Gardiner, deserted by his own soldiers in spite of all his attempts to rally them, yet spurring his horse through the field to take the command of a small body of infantry... Waverley could perceive that he had already received many wounds, his clothes and saddle being marked with blood. To save this good and brave man, became the instant object of his most anxious exertions. But he could only witness his fall. Ere Edward could make his way among the Highlanders, who, furious and eager for spoil, now thronged upon each other, he saw his former commander brought from his horse by the blow of a scythe, and beheld him receive, while on the ground, more wounds than would have let out twenty lives.'

Scott is thought to have based many of the traits of the Highland chieftain Fergus MacIvor in Waverley (1814) on his friend Alasdair (or Alexander) Ranaldson MacDonell, 15th Chief of Glengarry. Scott described him thus in his Journal (14 February 1826): 'This gentleman is a kind of Quixote in our age, having retained, in their full extent, the whole feelings of clanship and chieftainship, elsewhere so long abandoned. He seems to have lived a century too late, and to exist, in a state of complete law and order, like a Glengarry of old, whose will was law to his sept. Warmhearted, generous, friendly, he is beloved by those who know him, and his efforts are unceasing to show kindness to those of his clan who are disposed fully to admit his pretensions. To dispute them is to incur his resentment, which has sometimes broken out in acts of violence which have brought him into collision with the law. To me he is a treasure, as being full of information as to the history of his own clan, and the manners and customs of the Highlanders in general.'

Sharp was detested by the Covenanters for betraying the Presbyterian cause and playing a major role in the reintroduction of Episcopacy and oppression of the Covenanting party. In Tales of a Grandfather, Second Series (1829), Scott wrote of Sharp: 'He had some virtues, being learned, temperate, and living a life becoming his station; but his illiberal and intolerant principles, and the violences which he committed to enforce them, were the cause of great distress to Scotland, and of his own premature and bloody end.'

The Marquis of Argyll met Montrose in a series of battles, finally defeating him at Philiphaugh in 1645.

Scott's preacher Henry Warden is presented as second only in power and eloquence to Knox. In The Abbot even the Catholic Mary Queen of Scots salutes Knox's power, describing him as 'the ablest and most powerful of heresiarchs' (ch. 25). Scott also described Knox's role in the Reformation in the historical Tales of a Grandfather, First Series (1828), where Knox is introduced as 'a man of great courage, zeal, and talents' and as the 'bold and inflexible father of the Scottish Reformation'. For each of these works, Knox's own Historie of the Reformation of the Church of Scotland was an important source.

Sir Walter Scott's The Betrothed (1824) is a tale of Anglo-Welsh Border conflict set in the Welsh Marches. In ch. 9 an Anglo-Norman force lifts the siege of the castle of Garde Douleureuse. The defeated Welsh army are seen fleeing through the pass protected by the Castle: 'The single pass by which they could cross to the other side was soon completely choked by fugitives, on whose rear raged the swords of the victorious Normans. Many threw themselves into the river, upon the precarious chance of gaining the farther side, and, except a few, who were uncommonly strong, skilful, and active, perished among the rocks and in the currents'. To illustrate this scene, R. K. Penson has chosen to portray Dolbadern Castle and the Llanberis Pass, although neither is geographically close to the Welsh Marches.

Scott was particularly hurt by his critique of Marmion (1808), feeling that it might have been couched 'in language rather more civil to a personal friend'. While entertaining the highest regard for Jeffrey's talents, Scott felt he lacked 'the taste for poetry which is essentially necessary to enjoy and of course to criticize it with justice', and specifically 'that enthusiastic feeling which like sun-shine upon a landscape lights up every beauty and palliates if it cannot hide ever defect' (letter to Joanna Baillie, 31 October 1808).",Engraving,Engraving,"11.4 x 16.7cm (4 1/2 x 6 9/16"")",Ink,Paper,,,,,Engraving,TBC/Main Library/Special Collections,Corson Collection,"Chambers, R.
